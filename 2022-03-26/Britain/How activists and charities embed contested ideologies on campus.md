IN LATE 2020 administrators at Cambridge University tried to update its free-speech policy to say that faculty and students must be “respectful” of the views and identities of others, rather than merely “tolerating” them. Fearing a chilling effect on research and debate, several scholars succeeded in getting a secret vote on the change. Fully 87% of faculty rejected it.
Six months later the university proposed a scheme, “Change the Culture”, which encouraged reporting of “micro-aggressions”, such as turning your back on or raising an eyebrow at someone. Information left anonymously on a website called Report and Support (R&amp;S) would be held by the university and potentially shared with funding bodies. Opponents dubbed it the “snitch portal”.

Again they mobilised—and again successfully. Within days “Change the Culture” was withdrawn and a few months later the vice-chancellor, Stephen Toope, said he would leave his post two years early. The retreat was welcome, says James Orr, a philosopher who led the charge against the scheme, but should not be taken as evidence of a wider shift away from campus censoriousness. In fact, Cambridge was going against the tide. A report in July by Civitas, a think-tank, found that around 60% of British universities have an anonymous reporting tool, and a similar share are members of an external diversity and inclusion benchmarking scheme.
Supporters see reporting and benchmarking as essential to improving life for marginalised faculty and students. “There is a really clear pattern of systemic inequality right across the sector,” says David Bass of Advance HE, an education charity. Black students make up less than 4% of students in the elite “Russell Group” universities, he points out, compared with an average for all universities of 8%. Ethnic-minority students gain fewer first and upper-second degrees, and just 1% of professors are black. Benchmarking, says Mr Bass, is about “creating an environment where there is inclusion for everyone”.
But for critics, such schemes impose a contested ideological outlook and silence dissent. Not everyone agrees, for example, that micro-aggressions play any significant role in minority disadvantage on campus. Encouraging their reporting means universities are not only tacitly endorsing one side in an ongoing debate, but making it risky for staff or students to take the other, since doing so would probably count as a micro-aggression.
The point of a benchmarking scheme, meanwhile, is to shift norms to bring about a specific outcome. Typically, universities pay to be benchmarked, and pay again for training in how to do better. The result is that the external partner’s view of the world becomes institutionalised—even if that impinges on academic freedom. “What an ‘inclusive’ environment really means for these proponents of institutional reform is to silence dissenting views that do not accept their understood notion of justice,” says Jim McConalogue, one of the authors of the Civitas report.
Culture club
Among the most popular benchmarking schemes is Athena Swan, which is run by Advance HE and was set up to boost women in science and technology. In 2015 it recommended collecting data on the basis of self-declared “gender identity”, rather than sex. To join, a university must commit to narrowing the gap between men’s pay and women’s—a commitment blunted by the replacement of sex by gender identity, since that meant male academics being recorded as female if that was how they identified. And since some funding was linked to Athena Swan membership, academics who disagreed with the new, contested definition either had to remain silent or potentially suffer financial detriment.
After criticism, the connection between funding and membership of Athena Swan was dropped, and its charter was rewritten to acknowledge that biological sex is protected under equality law. But those were not the only changes. Now, rather than committing to “tackling the discriminatory treatment often experienced by trans people”, universities must commit to “fostering collective understanding that individuals have the right to determine their own gender identity”. That “opens the door to institutional thought-policing”, says Arif Ahmed, a Cambridge philosopher. (Mr Bass demurs, and says the charter is consistent with academic freedom.)
Similar problems arise with a “diversity champions” scheme run by Stonewall, a charity that campaigns on gay and trans issues. It requires members use its definition of terms such as “transphobia”, which it says means “denying [someone’s] gender identity or refusing to affirm it”. That leads universities to ignore legal provisions that permit single-sex spaces and instead tell students that they may use whichever toilets or changing facilities they feel match their identity. Dissent must be silenced, since any public indication that students or staff oppose the loss of single-sex spaces is likely to lead to being marked down.
A third diversity scheme to which a majority of universities have signed up is Advance HE’s Race Equality Charter. In 2021 Imperial College in London was awarded a bronze medal for having, among other things, brought in an R&amp;S anonymous-reporting tool and helped the engineering department launch a training video about micro-aggressions. Critics of the charter do not dispute that racial inequality exists, disagreeing only about whether it should always be understood as evidence of present-day discrimination—and therefore, whether such measures can do any good.
A planned Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) bill is supposed to help. Universities will be fined if they fail in their legal responsibility to foster free speech on campus, and a “free-speech champion” will be added to the board of the Office for Students, a regulatory body.
But when universities have outsourced their thinking about discrimination and inclusion, and encouraged anonymous reporting of dissent, such policies will not do much to change campus culture. Major legal clashes are coming, predicts Mr Orr. Universities that sign up to manifestos that commit staff and students to hold specific views on race, gender and equality—or at least to speak and act as if they do—cannot also uphold their duty to ensure free and open dialogue, he says. “There is going to be a lot of legal turmoil for higher-education institutions when it comes to working out which of those two needs to be subordinated to the other.” ■
