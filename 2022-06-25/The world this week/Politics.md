Gustavo Petro, a former leftist guerrilla, won  election. Mr Petro, an ex-mayor of Bogotá, will become the country’s first left-wing president in August. He won 50.4% of the vote to 47.3% for Rodolfo Hernández, a populist property tycoon. Investors are nervous; Mr Petro has sought to reassure them by suggesting he would appoint a centrist finance minister. But he still plans to ban oil exploration, open-pit mining and fracking, and give all persistently unemployed people a government job. Colombia’s currency and stockmarket wobbled after the result was announced. 
No majority for Macron
 suffered a serious political reverse when his electoral grouping, Ensemble, lost its majority in  parliamentary election. Only recently re-elected as president, Mr Macron faces the prospect of a second term in which he will find it hard to advance his legislative agenda.

 threatened  with “seriously negative” consequences for blocking rail shipments of goods subject to sanctions from Russia to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Lithuania says it is enforcing eu rules.
The  government said it would need to burn more coal. This reversal of previous green policies was part of a package of measures to avert an energy crisis caused by a reduction in gas flows from Russia. Households’ heating usage could also be capped. 
A bill that would enhance background checks for people under the age of 21 who try to buy a  advanced in the United States Senate. The bill has enough Republican support to overcome a filibuster. By global standards it is the mildest of gun-control bills, but John Cornyn, a Republican from , was booed at his party’s state convention for supporting it. The same convention rejected the election of Joe Biden in 2020 as illegitimate and vowed to abolish the Federal Reserve.
 unwieldy eight-party coalition government collapsed, paving the way to the country’s fifth election in four years. Under a prior arrangement Yair Lapid, who has been serving as foreign minister, will take over as a caretaker prime minister from Naftali Bennett. Binyamin Netanyahu, who was prime minister for 12 years before he was ousted by the coalition, will try to win back the top job. 
Muhammad bin Salman,  de facto ruler, visited  for the first time in years, hoping to normalise relations that were damaged when a Saudi journalist was murdered in 2018 at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul.

A court in  dismissed a challenge to the country’s ban on same-sex marriage. Three gay couples had argued that the ban was unconstitutional. Some parts of Japan, including Tokyo, offer something akin to civil partnership to same-sex couples. Most Japanese favour allowing gay marriage, but national law does not.
 launched satellites into orbit using its own rocket for the first time, a big advance in its ambition to become a space power. The first test of the Nuri rocket ended in failure last October when an engine burned out. 
 launched a new , its first to be locally designed and third overall (America, by comparison, has 11). The ship, which will use electromagnetic catapults to launch planes into the air, is still years away from active service. Days after its launch, 29 Chinese military aircraft, including fighters and bombers, flew near the airspace of Taiwan, which scrambled jets to shoo them away. Such incidents are becoming more common.
The British government gave its formal assent to the extradition to America of , who has been charged under America’s Espionage Act for publishing classified material on WikiLeaks. Mr Assange will appeal against the decision.

Britain wants to remain a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.
