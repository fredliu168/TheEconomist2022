Africans live globalised lives. Those who travel to work on Chinese-built roads may do so in Japanese minibuses emblazoned with images of players from European football leagues, pinging messages on American social-media platforms. They worry about rising prices, a global pandemic gumming up supply chains and a Russian dictator’s decision to invade Ukraine. 
China, against this background, is just one foreign influence among many. But it is seen differently. In April the survey  commissioned from Premise, a pollster, asked Africans in seven countries, a mix of democracies and authoritarian states, which would be more powerful in a decade’s time: China or America. In all seven the answer was China. Overwhelmingly they also felt that China’s influence was favourable, as well. 
Western countries instinctively see such views as warnings: ominous signs that they are losing a global battle for influence. There are certainly areas where it makes sense to think of China’s role on the continent as part of a broader struggle for power in the 21st century. The prospect of several Chinese military bases in African ports, a Chinese stranglehold over digital infrastructure and a grip on minerals that are vital to a greener future, the wooing of African political parties by the Chinese Communist Party: all of these things potentially threaten Western interests.

China’s engagement with Africa represents an opportunity for the West as well as a threat. To seize it means resisting the temptation to see everything China does as part of a zero-sum game. Chinese lending, construction or other business activities are not inherently bad or dangerous. Its growing role also offers a chance to understand how the world looks from Africa. African politicians have appreciated not just material help from Beijing, but also the sense of not being patronised. They like seeing their economies treated as business opportunities rather than places to run randomised trials for foreign aid. Appreciating why China is seen as powerful and popular would help Western policy towards Africa. 
Wisely, under Joe Biden, America has abandoned the Trump administration’s rigid approach of telling countries they must make a binary choice between America and China. The administration’s infrastructure programme, Build Back Better World (b3w), is seen as a response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. It was followed more recently by the eu’s Global Gateway infrastructure-for-Africa plan. Although thin on detail, these may yet turn out to be well-timed, given that China’s lending has dropped in recent years. More is needed. Neither b3w nor Global Gateway has yet translated into any concrete or asphalt. 
America and the West also ought to remember their strengths. If the West is unwilling to lend and build like China, it could encourage firms to invest in services, agribusiness and technology, and remove trade barriers that make it harder for African firms to export. It should redouble efforts to support democratic and civil-society institutions. It could be more generous in African debt crises. And it should welcome more African migrants. 
China has more swagger in its dealings with Africa. Xi Jinping and his envoys engage with Africa routinely; at the triennial China-Africa summits, Chinese leaders like to make splashy promises of new money and programmes. America makes valuable contributions in Africa, but less visibly. Its armed forces help African governments fight extremist groups. It has invested massively to improve public health, providing Western-made covid vaccines that work better than Chinese ones (and are free). In April the administration gave more than $200m in aid to the Horn of Africa, in response to a food crisis aggravated by Russia’s war in Ukraine. There is usually no harm in advertising Western efforts to support democracy, still the most popular form of government among Africans. And Mr Biden should also visit Africa. 
A less patronising Western approach would be well-timed. African governments no longer expect huge loans and mega-projects from China. China’s indulgence of Vladimir Putin and its punitive approach to countries such as Lithuania are a reminder that it can be a bully, too. For 20 years China has been a main partner for African governments seeking to transform their economies. Most African politicians, and their citizens, have appreciated the benefits arising from this relationship. But turning to China was often the only option. The West should offer an alternative.■
