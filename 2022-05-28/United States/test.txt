It was one of the first of the sexual-abuse scandals that for three decades have rippled through the Catholic church, devastating the institution. Millions of Americans and Europeans have left it. After a fresh round of scandals in 2018, concerning abuse of children in Pennsylvania, 37% of the remaining American Catholics said they were considering doing so.\nAmerica’s biggest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptists, now faces the same reckoning. In 2019 the Houston Chronicle revealed 380 allegations of sexual abuse in the denomination’s 47,000 affiliated churches. In response, its national executive stonewalled and prevaricated, leading to demands for an independent investigation. Its findings, made public this week, are even more shocking than expected.\nAbuses within the denomination appear to have been widespread, often committed by church leaders and systematically covered up. The report includes a “credible” allegation of sexual assault by a former president of the national executive, Johnny Hunt, against the wife of another pastor. It describes efforts by Southern Baptist officials to intimidate and denigrate as “opportunists” victims of assault and an overriding concern to stop them suing for compensation. A senior Southern Baptist leader is quoted denouncing victims’ complaints as a “satanic scheme to completely distract us from evangelism”.\nIt amounts to a familiar story: of privileged men exercising power with grubby and sometimes criminal impunity, then denying having done so to protect their institution and themselves. Secular institutions have seen plenty of that, of course. But it is probably no coincidence that the Catholic and Southern Baptist churches are among the most male-chauvinist Christian traditions. Nor is it by chance that some of their most censorious figures have turned out to be among the biggest abusers.\nThose named in the report include Paige Patterson and Paul Pressler, once-revered architects of the “conservative resurgence” of the 1970s and 80s that propelled Southern Baptists into politics. Mr Patterson, another former Southern Baptist president, was sacked from a leading seminary in 2018 after it was revealed that he had allegedly instructed one student not to report a rape and met privately with a victim of abuse in order to “break her down”. Mr Pressler, a former vice-president of the denomination, is accused of raping a boy.\nSouthern Baptists will discuss the report, which is already receiving pushback from conservatives, at their annual meeting in California next month. But even if their leadership accepts it contritely, the revelations seem likely to accentuate a decline in the white evangelical tradition that is already advanced. \nSince 2006, when Southern Baptist membership peaked at 16.3m, the group has lost 2.6m members, including over a million in the past three years. Formerly seen as an American bulwark against irreligiosity, white evangelicalism, of which Southern Baptists are the dominant strain, now looks to have been a brief holdout. It has been losing congregants at the same rate as the Catholic and mainline Protestant churches. In 2006, almost a quarter of Americans were white evangelicals; only 14% are today.\nThe decline has been most pronounced among those aged 18-29. Anecdotal evidence suggests they dislike the partisan alignment as much as the scandals Messrs Patterson and Pressler have wrought. Leah Boyd, a 23-year-old Southern Baptist seminarian and victim of assault within the church, estimates that of her 30 school friends in the Alabamian Bible belt, only ten attend services. “I’m an outlier,” she says. “It’s not just the sex-abuse scandals. People of my age are turned away by the positions on race, sexuality and gender.” And also, she adds, by white evangelicals’ embrace of Donald Trump, another alleged sexual predator. Southern Baptists “were supposed to be part of a moral majority”, she says.\nThe group’s politicisation has on the face of it provided a counterweight to secular decline. Voting in lock-step, white evangelicals have punched well above their dwindling numbers. They represent a plurality of the Republican coalition and are by far the country’s most powerful special interest. If America is about to lose the right to legal abortion, it will be by order of a conservative Supreme Court majority assembled to please them. Yet a cultural minority will struggle to win a culture war. And the damage white evangelicals’ political overreach is storing up is already obvious.\nThe Catholic church has survived the dire failures of its priesthood in part by emphasising other strengths, including the vigour of its charities, its growth in developing countries, and their ability to replenish dwindling rich-world vocations and congregations. In their partisan fury, America’s white evangelicals seem more intent on kicking their tradition’s crutches away.\nA secular decline\nSouthern Baptists’ core strengths are their decentralised structure and commitment to evangelising. Both attributes, emblematic of America’s singular religious tradition, contain the potential for rethinking and regrowth. Yet politicisation has blunted them in favour of groupthink and hostility to outsiders. Black and immigrant Southern Baptists, possible sources of renewal, have joined progressives in the rush to the exit. Dissident thinkers such as Russell Moore, a critic of the church’s response to the abuse scandal, and Beth Moore (no relation), one of its few notable women, have been driven out. New baptisms are close to record lows.\nThe sexual-abuse scandal is emblematic of these wider institutional failures. Conscientious evangelicals consider it proof of the persistence of sin. An alternative reading is that it indicates an institution that has abused its power over its own vulnerable members, just as it has in the public square.■\nRead more from Lexington, our columnist on
