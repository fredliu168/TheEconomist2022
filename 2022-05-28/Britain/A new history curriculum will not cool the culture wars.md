Politicians rarely need encouragement to tinker with the school curriculum. Over the past two years pressure to do just that has intensified. In 2020 campaigners energised by the Black Lives Matter movement called for the teaching of slavery and colonialism to be made compulsory in England’s classrooms. A year later a government report said that schools should teach more about the achievements of Britain’s minorities. 
The government has begun promoting a plan to improve history lessons for all children aged 5-14. A panel of experts will cook up a new “model curriculum” for history in England, to be published in 2024. This document will not alter the national curriculum; instead the idea is to illustrate, in unusual detail, how a high-performing history department might set about meeting its requirements. In February Robin Walker, the schools minister, told the  that this non-binding document would underline the breadth of material, from migration to world history, that can be taught under existing rules. He also offered that helping youngsters better understand the past would make them less likely to tear down statues.
The idea of using model curriculums to influence what happens in schools is a newish fad. The government’s first such effort—a model curriculum for England’s music teachers—was published last year. Its 100-odd pages include lists of pop songs and classical music that the government thinks children should hear (what the national curriculum requires of music teachers, by contrast, can be scribbled on only four sheets). The government seems to think that, though some schools are doing a good job of converting the national curriculum’s broad rules into zingy lessons, others need a lot more hand-holding.
Enthusiasm for model curriculums also reflects the fact that tweaking the national curriculum is no longer very appealing. The government needs Parliament’s approval to change that. And academies, which do not have to follow it, now make up nearly half of England’s schools. In theory model curriculums are also ignorable, but in practice they demand attention. Inspectors in England check to see whether teachers are using high-quality curriculums; where a detailed government model exists, schools may reasonably conclude that sticking to that is less risky than creating courses of their own. Model curriculums may influence the content that educational publishers put out. Primary-school teachers, in particular, may welcome help navigating sensitive topics concerning black and minority history. 
Decisions about what goes into the new history curriculum are a way off, but the arguments have already begun. Some warn that the exercise risks capture by “woke” academics, who will pack lessons with sombre moralising. Others reckon the risk skews the other way: a model curriculum that aims to stoke patriotism among minorities while swerving uncomfortable questions. The government has yet to announce who it has recruited to its panel of experts. Perhaps the biggest danger is that it can tempt only the shrillest voices. Some good candidates have declined to participate, says one insider. “They are suspicious of getting sucked into a trap.” ■
