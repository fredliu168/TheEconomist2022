“Explanations? of what?” With three words, the former king of Spain, Juan Carlos I, ensured that his first trip home for two years would make waves. Asked by a journalist if he would comment on the allegations that have dogged him for years, he suggested he had nothing to answer for. 
Juan Carlos arrived on May 19th in Sanxenxo, on the west coast. He attended a regatta, waved to admirers and stayed with a friend, trailed by “more cameras than at my wedding”, his daughter quipped. Only after a long weekend did he visit Madrid, and his son, the current king, Felipe VI. Juan Carlos spent 11 hours at his old home, but not the night—apparently at Felipe’s request. 
The former king has lived in Abu Dhabi since 2020, under a cloud of legal and personal scandal. He recently paid Spain €4.4m ($4.7m) in back taxes. But he is accused of taking a “commission” for helping a Spanish consortium win a high-speed rail bid in Saudi Arabia, which he denies. Spanish prosecutors have dropped the charges against him, saying that the events either have passed the statute of limitations or occurred when he was covered by his constitutional immunity as king.
But he has been unable to explain a $100m gift from the Saudi royal family, and the role he might have played in the rail contract. A former lover, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, says he gave her €65m in 2012, then asked for it back. When she refused, she says, she was harassed by the Spanish intelligence service, for which she has sued him in London, where she lives. Earlier this year, a judge there threw out his claim of immunity and let her suit proceed.
Commentators and politicians sputtered at Juan Carlos’s visit. The radical-left Podemos party reiterated its call for a republic. The right-wing parties treated criticisms of the former king as an attack on the monarchy itself. The Socialists, who head the government, tried to walk a line between the two, saying Juan Carlos had missed a chance to explain and ask for forgiveness, while praising Felipe for his transparency (he recently disclosed his personal assets). 
The king is described in the constitution as a symbol of unity. Felipe tries hard to play the part. His father, long remembered for a heroic role in Spain’s transition to democracy, as well as for his common touch, is now apparently past caring who is annoyed by his antics. He says he wants to “normalise” his visits to Spain, and will return in June—for another regatta.
