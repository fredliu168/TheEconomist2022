Even as a boy, Ismail Can, a Turkish shepherd, knew that the large mound outside his village, known as Karahan Tepe, contained wonders. Flint fragments, once used as tools, littered the mountainous area (about an hour’s drive from Sanliurfa, a city in southern Turkey). Large slabs of limestone, clearly hewed and shaped by human hands, emerged from the earth. 
Mounds like Karahan Tepe had been largely ignored until the 1990s, when Klaus Schmidt, a German archaeologist, began excavating a similar site about 50km to the west. That mound, known as Gobekli Tepe, or Potbelly Hill, was previously assumed to be a Byzantine graveyard. It turned out to be a monumental complex, adorned with reliefs of animals and containing scores of giant T-shaped monoliths. Arranged in circles, like people huddled around a fire, the monoliths are thought to represent humans or human-like gods. Carbon dating revealed that the site preceded the Byzantines by some 10,000 years and Stonehenge by 6,000. Gobekli Tepe has since shot to fame as the world’s oldest temple. 
When, for the first time in millennia, its artefacts began to see the light, Mr Can understood that the ones buried near his home would prove no less remarkable. He and other village boys showed foreign and Turkish archaeologists around the surrounding hills. For long years, until the official excavations began, his father protected the place from treasure-hunters and looters. The digging began in 2019. The site was opened to the public earlier this year; Mr Can now works as a guide.
Karahan Tepe has pried open another window into the early Neolithic era—and what may have been the beginning of human civilisation. The rectangular slabs Mr Can saw poking out of the ground turned out to be the tops of large T-shaped pillars, like the ones at Gobekli Tepe, which were used to prop up a series of round enclosures. The two sites are roughly contemporaneous, both dating back to the tenth millennium bc, though Karahan Tepe may be younger by a few hundred years. 
The similarities are striking, but the differences may be more important still. The focus at Gobekli Tepe seems to have been on the animal world. Stone foxes, scorpions and snakes, as well as animals such as leopards that have long vanished from the region—all of them male—appear poised to pounce from the monoliths.
By contrast, at Karahan Tepe (pictured) people begin to take centre stage. Human eyes glare from reliefs and carvings. A small room, reached via a narrow opening, contains 11 statues of phalluses. Along the walls runs a channel that delivered a stream of liquid, possibly blood or semen, to a receptacle in the adjacent enclosure. A snake with a human head overlooks the scene. The room seems to have been used for some kind of initiation ceremony. 
The finds at Gobekli Tepe were revolutionary. Historians had assumed farming was a precondition for human settlement, which in turn preceded organised religion. Gobekli Tepe upended that theory. 
Archaeologists found no traces of agriculture or husbandry in the vicinity. The hunter-gatherers who constructed the walls, and worshipped inside them, seem to have discovered religion long before they discovered farming. This sequence may also explain why they eventually buried and abandoned the temple. With time, the monoliths and enclosures of Gobekli Tepe became smaller and the workmanship sloppier. Perhaps, as hunting and foraging gave way to agriculture, the old gods gave way to new ones.
Karahan Tepe contains more clues about the transition. The people who built Gobekli Tepe saw themselves as part of the animal universe. Those behind Karahan Tepe already appear to have considered themselves a separate, superior species. “We see this as a turning-point,” says Necmi Kurul of Istanbul University, who has led the excavations. “Here, man starts to place himself at the centre of the cosmos.”
Signs and wonders
On the road to Karahan Tepe, between empty expanses and hills strewn with rocks, villagers collect wild herbs. Olive trees catch the spring breeze. Flocks of sheep block advancing cars. The dry ground under their hooves may hide yet more wonders. Surveys have confirmed the presence of at least 16 prehistoric ritual sites in the area, says Mr Kurul. Besides Gobekli Tepe and Karahan Tepe, excavation is ongoing at six of them. The countryside around Sanliurfa may contain many more.
The T-shaped pillars and reliefs at the sites unearthed so far suggest the people who congregated in their shadows shared a common religion or culture. For a while, Gobekli Tepe was thought to be both the focal point and the pinnacle of that culture, a sort of cathedral among churches, or a pilgrimage site. With the discovery of Karahan Tepe, which may be even bigger (only a fraction of each has been excavated), that view is now being revisited. 
The rest is a mystery as inscrutable as the monoliths themselves. What inspired groups of people living at the end of the ice age to build temples by hauling huge blocks of limestone up mountains, and who presided over the back-breaking labour, is anyone’s guess. Other than the fact that it was deeply patriarchal—the giant phalluses speak for themselves—there are few clues as to how their society worked. 
Whatever brought the hunter-gatherers of Upper Mesopotamia together endured. Gobekli Tepe was used more or less continuously from 9500 to 8000bc, the same span of time as between the collapse of the Roman Empire and the advent of space travel. The temples seem to have lived and died with their architects. Every few generations, the enclosures were buried, along with the monoliths, only for new ones to be erected next door. No one knows why. Today, one shovel of dirt at a time, they have begun to come back to life. ■
