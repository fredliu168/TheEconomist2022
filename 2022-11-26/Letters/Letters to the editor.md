Adapting to climate change
You characterised the options for climate mitigation as being either new energy technologies (carbon capture, hydrogen, negative emissions and so on) or geoengineering (“”, November 5th). This is wrong, damaging and costly. It is wrong because between voluntary behaviour change and new energy-infrastructure technologies lies a whole spectrum of options to live well using today’s technologies differently. For example, since the early 1990s average car weights have risen to more than 12 times the weight of the people in them, global flights have quadrupled, mainly for leisure, and new commercial buildings have been knocked down and replaced on average in less than 50 years. Efficiency is about systems and equipment, not motors. We could have lives very similar to today’s, with half the energy input, all of it electric, by changing specific equipment (such as cars and boilers) without requiring any noticeable asceticism.
It is damaging, because politicians and the leaders of high-emitting companies will take every excuse to avoid action today, if they are given any hope of easier action later. Apart from the year of the pandemic, global emissions have risen every year since we agreed to reduce them. This has been excused every year by the promise that new technologies will arrive to make the solution easier. They haven’t and we cannot afford any further inaction.
It is costly because the price of unmitigated climate change is far greater than yet appreciated. The starvation of hundreds of millions of people in the second half of this century will lead to a world war of incalculable suffering. But the techno-fantasy of solving climate change with new and invisible energy technologies removes the incentive to innovate in the vast space of opportunity in which more benefit is delivered from less resources. The Tesla of material recycling, the Amazon of resource efficiency, the IKEA of retrofit, the Starbucks of tele-present meals, all are waiting to be born, once we prick the false belief that magic technologies will take away the problem.

Your comprehensive and realistic leader on climate change nevertheless omitted one very important alternative to fossil fuels: the resources of the sea. The sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, but tides and waves are constant. The first patent for wave energy was taken out in 1799. You are not alone in this depressing neglect. The British government also responds mostly to the big organisations developing solar and wind power, thus ignoring the potential of what these islands have in abundance.

 is that even in the IPCC’s most ambitious emission scenario the world is expected to reach 1.5°C in 2030. We recently published research on future temperatures. The fact is that not only very optimistic but also very pessimistic scenarios are now much less probable. The likelihood of catastrophic emission levels have become very unlikely. This is because the cost of solar, wind and batteries has been dramatically reduced and because renewables now outcompete coal in certain countries even without subsidies.
However, if we do not further bend the curve of emissions and global temperature trajectories, and close the gap to get as close to 1.5°C as possible, the physical impacts of warming in excess of 2°C will threaten the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. The original Bretton Woods conference in 1944 created the financial architecture required to lift the world out of the darkness of the second world war. A similar Bretton Woods meeting to reset the priorities of the world’s financial architecture is required to prepare the global system to deal with climate change.

One adaptation example you cited was to give farmers hardier strains of crops. This is innovative, but there are also biological seed treatments that boost yields in degraded soil while potentially eliminating the need for nitrogen fertilisers, hence no emissions. 
Or, instead of focusing solely on cyclone warnings or building dykes as flood protection, how about 3D printing geopolymer cement homes that are hurricane proof. They have the added benefit of a 90% lower carbon footprint and can be up to 30% more affordable than a traditionally built house. Adaptation versus elimination of global warming shouldn’t be an either/or, it should be an “and”. Too many compromises are what got us into this mess in the first place, so we now need to get our act together and both adapt to and fix the problems at the same time.

I was depressed to read the section on adapting farming to tackle climate change in your special report on climate adaptation (). A similar recipe for improving African farm productivity could have been cut and pasted from any number of reports from a range of institutions over the past three decades. The recipe goes like this: first quote an analysis by the World Bank or some other respected big-hitter, then mention something about potential gains in applying improved technology taken out of a report from CGIAR (a network of agricultural institutes), then list some new silver-bullet remedies, ending with an upbeat assessment of how these “solutions” will pay for themselves. 
Sensible people involved in African agricultural development will tell you that it is not the amount of money being spent that is the problem but the quality of the spending. There are no silver bullets. 
 The most ineffective use of money is to endlessly fund the same institutions that have not been effective enough to make a substantial difference over past decades. Isn’t it time to give up the CGIAR so that we can smell the coffee?

“Adaptation has always been the neglected stepchild of climate policy,” you say. Indeed, adaptation is often overlooked. Perhaps world leaders should recall this perspicacious advice attributed to Charles Darwin, which arguably applies to countries as well as species: it is not the strongest that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the ones most responsive to change.

Being a big fan of Pink Floyd I enjoyed your choice of titles in your briefing. Might I suggest “Obscured by clouds” or “Meddle” to lead the section on geoengineering, “More” as the projection of carbon-dioxide levels and “The piper at the gates of dawn” to finish it off.

Bangladesh responds
To set the record straight, the Bangladeshi government did not oust Muhammad Yunus from Grameen (“”, October 15th). Even aged 70, Mr Yunus was clinging to the position of chief executive. The legal retirement age is 60. When he took the matter to the appeals court, it ruled against him resulting in his resignation.  therefore, disregards the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.
Bangladesh’s anti-corruption commission, an independent statutory body, does not act on the whim of political governments. The commission is investigating Mr Yunus and three other Grameen Telecom board directors over allegations of embezzlement. Does  suggest that Nobel laureates are above the law? Or that letting the law take its own course is tantamount to “rising authoritarianism”?
’s attempt to establish a non-political Mr Yunus as a “viable political opponent” to Sheikh Hasina, who has been elected prime minister four times, or as an “alternative” to her regime is an 
utter insult to democratic processes. Does  propose an internationally engineered puppet government to topple the vibrant democracy that Bangladesh is?
