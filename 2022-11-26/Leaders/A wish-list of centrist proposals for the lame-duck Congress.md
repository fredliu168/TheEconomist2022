When members of Congress return to Washington next week, Thanksgiving will be over and the annual festival of asking for stuff will begin.  has its own wish-list for members of the House and Senate in the lame-duck session, when legislators can be more open to doing business. Since the biggest obstacle to these wishes being granted is the Senate filibuster, which means finding ten Republican votes, this list is particularly aimed at the five Republican senators who are retiring, plus those who voted for the chips Act and infrastructure law, both of which passed with Republican support. In journalism, branches of government and adorations of the Magi, three is the magic number. But we are greedy, so here are five.
First, as this week’s  points out, hundreds of thousands of people brought to America as children—the Dreamers—still have to reapply every two years for permission to remain in the country. America’s immigration system has , but the inability of Congress to tackle this one is striking. Do the retiring members of Congress want their successors to think it was beyond them? Some Dreamers are entering middle age. Do Senate Republicans want to keep up the pretence that they may one day be deported? And, if so, where to?
Second, fund Ukraine’s heroic resistance. Vladimir Putin’s strategy is to wait out the West, and bomb and freeze Ukraine into submission. Ukraine needs to know that its Western allies have more patience than Mr Putin thinks they do. Funding support for Ukraine until the end of 2023, or even better until the end of 2024, would undermine his plan. American weapons and Ukrainian bravery have so far proved a potent combination. Out of the total Congress made available, about $19bn of security assistance has already gone to Ukraine. That is less than 4% of the Pentagon’s annual budget. The administration has asked Congress to grant a further $38bn, most of it for security. What this money buys is priceless—not only Ukrainian resistance, but also American protection from Mr Putin’s aggression. Senate Republicans have been firm supporters of Ukraine. House Republicans, who from January will be in the majority, may be less so.
Third, pass a reform of the Electoral Count Act of 1887. This law seemed archaic until Donald Trump used it to advance the theory that state legislatures could overturn election results, or that the vice-president could decide the outcome. The reform that emerged from the Senate’s rules committee makes it clear that the vice-president’s role is ceremonial and that state legislatures cannot simply declare an election “failed”. It also speeds up the legal process for resolving electoral disputes. Passing it would help prevent a repeat of the violence of January 6th 2021, when Trump fans invaded Congress to force the result to change. It would also be a sign that America is repairing its democracy. Plenty of Republican senators have expressed support.
Fourth, raise the debt ceiling until the next presidential election is over. Even after Congress has appropriated money, members are asked whether they want to permit the maximum borrowing allowed, if extra is needed to make good on the ious they have written. A request to raise the debt ceiling comes around about once a year, though sometimes it is more frequent than that. Congress has always voted in favour, though it has occasionally done so late and only after throwing a tantrum. The incoming Republican House majority may want to use the debt-ceiling vote to extract concessions from the White House. But it is an empty threat: a sovereign default would crash the world economy and make America poorer and weaker. There are better ways to shrink the size of the state that do not involve making millions of people unemployed and destroying America’screditworthiness. Better not to pretend it is an option.
Fifth, reform permitting laws to make it easier to build new green-energy projects (including nuclear ones) and new electric grids. Through a mixture of government subsidies and private markets, the amount of capital flowing into clean-energy technologies and renewables schemes in America is poised to surge. But none of this will happen if new projects are delayed for decades by misguided rules on environmental permitting. This is an area where the White House, the swing Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, and Senate Republicans all agree.
Honour the midterm spirit
One of the heartening outcomes of the midterm elections was that the extremes did badly. Democratic candidates ditched ideas like defunding the police and were rewarded for their moderation. Our analysis of results found that Republican candidates backed by Mr Trump did about five points worse than they would have without his endorsement, and election deniers did even worse. This is a good moment to turn the assertion of the moderate centre into a legislative programme. ■
