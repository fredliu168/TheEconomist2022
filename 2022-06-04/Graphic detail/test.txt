of the earliest employees of the United States government were statisticians. Their methods may have been primitive by today’s standards, but the so-called enumerators were bound by the constitution once a decade to record where each person in the country lived. These tallies are used to draw the boundaries of the districts represented by each member of the House of Representatives. State politicians, who are charged with redistricting, typically try to draw maps that benefit their own side, within limits set out by state constitutions and federal judges. The maps must divide the population roughly equally, must not split up racial minorities unnecessarily and not be excessively funny shapes. Aside from that, anything goes.\nA year after they received the enumerators’ latest counts, officials in each state have now completed this decade’s round of redistricting. The last cycle, in 2010-2012, came at a low point for Democrats. With Republicans riding high in state legislatures, they drew maps that heavily favoured their own side. The new boundaries were supposed to be better for the Democrats than the last set, since this latest round of redistricting happened after a good 2020 for the party. Some election-watchers predicted that pro-Democratic gerrymanders would even things out, eliminating the bias of the chamber altogether before November’s mid-terms.\n\n\n\nIn the end the new maps will still be lopsided, but are less biased towards Republicans than they were after the 2010 census. According to The Economist’s analysis of results for the presidential elections since 2008, compiled by FiveThirtyEight, a data-journalism website, Republicans could have held onto the majority of seats in the House in 2012 while losing the popular vote by 4.3 percentage points. In fact, Republicans did win a hefty majority in 2012 while losing the popular vote by one point. This November, Republicans could pull off the same feat while losing by as much as 2.5 points. Any less, and Democrats are favoured to hold their majority.\n\n\n\nLess biased maps are an improvement. But partisan mapmakers have also managed to make members of Congress even safer than they were already. The number of truly competitive seats—defined as those where Democrats or Republicans have won by fewer than five points relative to the national popular vote over the previous two election cycles—will fall from 46 to 40 out of a total of 435. (That is already down from 54 in 2010.) Put another way, less than 10% of seats will be competitive in November. Republicans have accomplished this by giving up some ground in competitive seats in exchange for shoring-up their margins in friendlier areas. For nine in ten members of the House of Representatives, the primary is the only election they need to worry about. ■\nFor a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts,
