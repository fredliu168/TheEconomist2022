Her first solo engagement took place in 1942, when she inspected the Grenadier Guards at Windsor Castle. More than 21,000 ribbon-cuttings and plaque-unveilings have followed, along with 200-plus official portraits and over 300,000 congratulatory telegrams sent to centenarian subjects. From June 2nd to June 5th Britain celebrates another milestone for Queen Elizabeth II: the Platinum Jubilee, to mark her 70 years on the throne.
Much of what will unfold over the  is objectively ludicrous. People in large hats will parade around on horses. A lunch in Windsor will feature an attempt on the coveted record of the world’s longest dining table. The law of large numbers suggests that someone will die in a bizarre jubilee-themed accident—choking on a Scotch egg, perhaps, or garrotted by bunting. Yet despite the weirdness, the jubilee is not a trifle (though a trifle is the official Platinum Pudding). 
, a 19th-century editor of , divided the British constitution into two branches, the dignified and the efficient. The jubilee—and more specifically, the woman at its heart—will show that the monarch, the exemplar of the dignified state, is holding up her end of the bargain. That matters all the more when the government, far from being efficient, is  and introspection. The virtues that the queen represents, of continuity and consensus, are not small qualities in modern Britain.
By its very nature, the jubilee represents continuity. A 70-year reign is unprecedented for an English monarch. The queen has been through 14 prime ministers, and may meet her 15th soon enough. She has met four popes and 13 American presidents; only Lyndon Johnson did not touch her white gloves. She has been a thread running through the lives of millions of Britons, 87% of whom have known no other head of state. A hereditary monarchy is designed to survive the death of the incumbent: the queen, who is 96, is already handing over some of her duties to Prince Charles. But her personal longevity has symbolised the constancy of the state even when other institutions falter.
As for consensus, that lies in the approval the queen enjoys. Eight in ten Britons have a positive opinion of her; people of all ages think of her favourably. Broad agreement is a rarer thing in Britain than it once was. More people still see themselves as Leavers or Remainers than as loyal to a political party. 
Politicians seek out wedge issues to galvanise their own supporters, and symbols of state are not exempt. The government talks up pride in the flag. It touts the use of the crown symbol on pint glasses as liberation from eu tyranny (it really isn’t). It is mulling the return of imperial measurements, doubtless hoping that the thought of opening Instapound on their phone will stoke fervour among supporters. The queen transcends such nonsense: she is a unifying figure in a more tribal country. 
It has not always been this way. The queen’s stiff upper lip did her no favours after the death of Princess Diana in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Yet the consensus in her favour now flows from those same old-fashioned virtues of duty and of self-control.
Bagehot reckoned that the parochialism of a royal family was a source of constitutional strength: it “sweetens politics by the seasonable addition of nice and pretty events”. The “petty life” of which he wrote will be on full display this weekend, in the endless dramas that swirl around the queen’s children and grandchildren. The uncharitable view of Elizabeth is as a cipher with a handbag. But she has kept her corner of the British state worthy of celebration in the minds of millions. Whatever your view of monarchy, that is an achievement. ■
