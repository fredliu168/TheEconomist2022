“It doesn’t matter how lucky you are”, says the protagonist of Leila Mottley’s debut novel, “because you still gotta work day in and day out trying to stay alive while someone else falls through the cracks.” “Nightcrawling” tells the compelling story of a young black woman who, despite her best efforts, finds herself “stuck between street and gutter”. Set in the author’s native Oakland, California, and inspired by a true crime which made headlines in 2015, the book is both a searing depiction of sexual exploitation and a gripping account of a struggle for survival.
Seventeen-year-old Kiara Johnson has had her unfair share of hard knocks. Her father is dead and her mother is in rehab. She lives with her brother Marcus, a fellow high-school dropout, in a rundown apartment complex generously called the Regal-Hi. As he follows his deluded dream of making it as a rap star, she is forced to act practically. Kiara divides her time between searching for a job to cover their rent and caring for Trevor, the nine-year-old son of her drug-addicted neighbour. 
A fateful drunken encounter with a man who believes her to be a sex worker leads Kiara to resort to desperate measures to stay afloat. “It’s just a body,” is the mantra she repeats to herself as she takes to the city’s streets after dark. She realises that there is more to it than that when she is picked up by police officers and turned against her will into their personal plaything. There is the sex, she says, “and then there is the terror, the fear, the marble white of their eyes”.
Deprived of choices, Kiara is manipulated and misused by the very men who should protect and help her. A way out presents itself when one police officer kills himself and leaves behind a suicide note which incriminates his colleagues. She is given the opportunity to name and shame her abusers in a grand jury trial. But does she have the courage to speak out, and will her voice be heard?
Much of the novel makes for a sobering read. However, its grittier sections are grimly captivating and throughout them Ms Mottley—who is almost 20—conveys corruption, brutality, injustice and suffering in a manner that is hard-hitting but never heavy-handed. She offsets Kiara’s ordeals with moments of happiness, like the valuable time spent with Trevor or best friend Alé, and she ensures her court-case climax is a nail-biting final stretch. 
Ms Mottley has a background in poetry and in 2018 she was chosen as Oakland’s youth poet laureate. Some of her imagery is overblown (“her eyelashes short ghosts framing her eyes”), but more often than not it is rich and inventive. “Fear don’t do nothing but paint red across the neck, tell them all how easy it is to split you open.” This is an accomplished first novel with a remarkable heroine whom the reader wills on every step of the way. ■
