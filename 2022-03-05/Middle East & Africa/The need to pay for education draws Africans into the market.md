# The need to pay for education draws Africans into the market 
##### But not all earn enough to afford it

IN JANUARY SCHOOLS in Uganda reopened after nearly two years of covid-19 closures. That was a source of delight to poor parents who hope to improve their children’s prospects through education. But it was also a source of dread for many others, since they knew they would struggle to afford to pay the fees.
Prossy Nabatebeka, a firewood-seller in Masaka district, took on casual work to pay for her children’s schooling, digging ditches in a rich man’s pineapple field. Her 14-year-old daughter became a labourer, too, heaving charcoal onto trucks. Others sold assets to raise enough money. Alex Matwiga, a local land-dealer, said that he was handling twice as many transactions as in usual months because parents were selling land at fire-sale prices, mostly to government officials or traders from town. “People don’t have other options,” he explained. “They are in the squeeze.”

In theory, schooling is free in Uganda. In practice, most spending on education comes from parents, rather than the government or foreign donors. Parents have to chip in for materials, upkeep, uniforms and exam fees, or sometimes just to hire an extra teacher. The cost of these “school fees” is so high that half of Ugandan households have seen a child drop out for financial reasons, according to Twaweza, an east African NGO.
In many parts of Africa (as elsewhere), the transformation of subsistence farmers into wage-earners or petty entrepreneurs is the starting-point for development. The shift makes countries richer and lets people lift themselves out of poverty. Across much of Africa, however, this transition is incomplete. Most folk in the countryside still cultivate small plots of their own. One of the forces pitching them into the market economy is the need to earn money to pay for something that nearly all of them desire: education for their children.
In colonial times, British officials imposed “hut taxes” to force Africans into the cash economy. Needing money to pay the tax, farmers would have to grow cash crops or work in mines. Also, since the industrial revolution people have changed their habits so as to be able to afford new consumer goods, perhaps by working longer hours or finding jobs away from the farm.
School fees work in both these ways. They are a bit like a tax, because families have little choice but to pay them. And they are a bit like a consumer good, because aspirational parents can upgrade to a private school. Most important, though, is that they are an investment. Enock Chikava was one of 11 children of smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe. His parents used money earned by growing crops to educate their children. “Everyone needs money for school fees, which is the actual mobility out of poverty,” he says. “All the 11 of us, no one is on the farm today, but it is the farm that…is the springboard.” These days he is in charge of agricultural development for the Gates Foundation, a charity.
After food, education is one of the biggest items in household budgets. The “financial diaries” of poor families in Kenya reveal that education swallows 11% of their spending, rising to 18% among those who rely mostly on farming.
School fees encourage farmers to plant cash crops such as coffee, which Ugandans rarely consume themselves. They also give new meaning to familiar goods. In the cattle-keeping region of Karamoja herders are loth to part with their cows, which are a source of cultural pride, but will sell a heifer to educate a child. Samali Marika, an elder there, lists the uses of a cow as milk, meat, ploughing, bride price—and paying for school.
Meanwhile school imposes its own calendar, which jars with the rhythms of the harvest. When term begins, desperate parents are at the mercy of the middlemen who buy their crops. In 2010 the government of Malawi brought forward the start of the school year by three months, forcing parents to sell when prices were low. A study by Brian Dillon of Cornell University estimates that they missed out on price increases of 17-27% as a result.
One way to bridge these time discrepancies is through savings and credit. Some parents join savings clubs, depositing a small sum each month and taking it in turns to receive a windfall. Others borrow from banks. Robert Canwat, the micro finance manager at Centenary Bank in Uganda, says that it started offering loans for education after noticing that some borrowers were using loans intended for their businesses to pay school fees. Demand peaks at the start of the second term in May, before the first harvest. National surveys find that a fifth of all loans in Uganda are used to pay for school.
As beneficial as this process is in the long run, parents are often paying for things which are supposed to be funded by the state, and which they themselves can ill afford. Half of Tanzanian parents surveyed by Twaweza in 2017 said they had contributed to school construction over the previous year. Tom Job Acire, a deputy head teacher in Gulu district in Uganda, says the government sends only 7,000 shillings ($2) a term for each pupil, so parents are forced to contribute. It is, he says, “an economic war” on the poor.
Nighty Aciro, a single mother in Gulu district, says that only two of her five children have resumed their studies. The local primary school is asking for 40,000 shillings a pupil for the term ahead, the equivalent of seven days’ casual labour. For now the other three children play between the smouldering kilns where hard-up parents bake bricks for sale. Without an education, they are unlikely to escape the toil to which she has been forced to resort to send their siblings to school. ■
