one was no beauty. It was an oblong block of red sandstone, 26 inches long by 16.7 wide by 10.5 deep, rough-hewn and chisel-pocked. One face was incised with a crude cross, and two iron rings on chains were set into the ends. By young Ian Hamilton’s estimate—for he had borrowed book after book on it from the Mitchell Library in Glasgow, where he was studying law at the university—it weighed four hundredweight: in fact it weighed 336lb, or 152 kilos. It was also crammed tightly under the ancient wooden coronation chair of the kings and queens of England in Westminster Abbey. All this made it difficult to abscond with. But that was what he meant to do. \n           For the Stone of Destiny, as this was, did not belong to England. It belonged to Scotland, and was the seat of Scottish kings. Legends hung thickly round it, instilled in his head by his mother. This was the pillow on which Jacob had slept, dreaming of angels descending and ascending again to heaven. The prophet Jeremiah had brought it to Ireland, where it became the seat of the High Kings. Thence it came to Scotland. It was ripped from Scone Abbey by Edward I in 1296, since Scotland could not prosper if it was gone. Edward III later promised to return it, but never had. Now, in 1950, 650 years later, a 25-year-old chain-smoking student was proposing to right a great wrong. \n           He did not do so because he hated the English. Though he came across the border like a reiver bent on plunder, he admired England in many ways. Rather than steal cattle or blow up bridges, he intended nothing violent. He had signed the Covenant of 1949 that demanded self-government in Scotland, but he was loyal to the English king; he did not seek separation, just a better union. More than anything, he wanted to wake Scotland up to its own greatness, its history and shared identity. Since the Stone symbolised all that, its restitution would be a rallying cry. And no blood would be shed in doing it. \n             So the plot was hatched, with him as the mastermind and three other students, Gavin Vernon, Alan Stuart and Kay Mathieson, joining in. Matters soon turned farcical. His first plan, to hide in the Abbey at night and open a door from the inside, was foiled when a watchman found him. The next day, Christmas Day in the small hours, they managed to break in at the Poets’ Corner Entrance, but made a noise with their huge jemmy fit to wake the dead. When at last they got the Stone out and onto his coat to be dragged (he insisting that his coat should have that honour), he pulled a ring too hard, and the Stone broke in two. For a sickening moment, he seemed to have destroyed what he had come to save. \n            Yet it was not so. Despite all their fumblings, the more than canny force of the Stone worked in their favour. In two pieces it was easier to carry, and at times he barely felt the weight at all; he picked up the smaller chunk like a rugby ball, slid it into the clapped-out Ford Anglia which was the first getaway car, and the car fired instantly. Improbably he and Kay, the driver, managed to divert a policeman by posing as lovers looking for a hotel. Miraculously, returning to the pitch-black abbey for the second chunk, he trod on the mislaid keys to the second getaway car. Everyone got clean away. When he had first touched the Stone, though he was not especially religious, he had felt the soul of Scotland in his hands. What he did not expect was that, henceforward, the Stone would also hang around his neck.\n               At first, this was exciting. England and Scotland both went wild over the theft; for a while, the border was even closed. Yet he and his helpers had no idea what to do with the Stone. They hid one piece in Kent, the other in Birmingham, before reuniting them in Scotland. Within four months, however, they realised that they would have to give it back. He left it, draped in a Saltire, on the altar of the ruined abbey in Arbroath, and swore not to look at it again until Scotland was free. Policemen recovered it, locking it in a mean cell like common loot, and took it back to Westminster.\n                 Having escaped prosecution (another miracle), he then resumed his legal career. By 1953 he was already famous as a second petitioner in a landmark case, MacCormick v Lord Advocate, over whether Queen Elizabeth II should be plain “Queen Elizabeth” in Scotland. The first Elizabeth, after all, had never ruled there. The ruling went against him, but he had exposed deficiencies in the Act of Union of 1707, and that made his name. He became a much-respected criminal lawyer in Scotland, as well as director of civil litigation in Zambia and rector of Aberdeen University. In the Scottish National Party, which he joined in 1992, his views on the union hardened, and his two memoirs burned with nationalist polemic. In 1994 he stood in European elections for Strathclyde East, in 1999 for the Scottish Parliament for Greenock. Though he lost both races, he was revered as an elder in the party. \n                      Yet he often felt he had no identity except the Stone. For years he was “the Stone man”, little else. He would not talk about it, for fear of becoming invisible; though he laughed at his youthful daftness, he struggled to get rid of that shadow. The rebel in him—the one who jumped off a bridge for a drunken bet and roared round on a motorbike in his 80s—was still proud of what he had done, and rejoiced in having been called a “vulgar vandal”. The thoughtful lawyer felt ashamed that the Stone had made him famous, when the names of the airmen who had died in the war, in which he had volunteered as an RAF mechanic, had long been forgotten.  \n                      In 2008 a film came out about the raid.  The publicity reunited him with the Stone, which in 1996 had been returned on loan to Edinburgh Castle. He could look at it now because Scotland, though still not free, was awake, and the flood-tide was flowing.  \n                       No new encounter, though, could dislodge the image of their last, when he had left the Stone at Arbroath. It lay in its Saltire, blue against the blood-red broken walls of the nave: merely an oblong block of the same sandstone, rough-hewn and chisel-pocked, cracked (though since mended), with iron chains at its ends. Yet as he gazed, he heard the voice of Scotland crying out defiance. ■","description":"The lawyer and activist who liberated the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey died on October 3rd, aged
