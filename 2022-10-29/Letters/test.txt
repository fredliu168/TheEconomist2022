hunger\nDespite the ambitious global goal to end hunger by 2030, including malnutrition, estimates in 2021 showed that 23% of children under five have had their growth stunted by a lack of food. Recent projections suggest this number will be reduced by only another 2% by 2030. The world must, and can, do better, so I was pleased to see you focused on the potential for rebalancing microbiomes as a strategy for accelerating progress toward this goal (“Gut reactions”, October 1st). \nIncreasing investments in the research and development of new approaches are vital to unlocking solutions that address the root causes of entrenched issues, such as malnutrition or low agricultural productivity for small-holder farmers. The Gates Foundation has seen the role of innovation and ingenuity accelerate, such as in drastically reducing \nchild deaths and HIV infections. It’s why we’re encouraged by, and funding the work that icddr,b, a research institute in Dhaka, is leading \nand the WHO is testing. \nMark Suzman\nChief executive officer\nBill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation\nSeattle\n\nOwn goals\nThe parting of FIFA and EA Sports after the latter’s long track record of making “FIFA” video games is a bizarre decision, and will impact both parties’ balance-sheets (“It’s no longer in the game”, digital editions, September 30th). At upwards of $60 for each annual, hardly altered reboot, FIFA games are a shining example of price-gouging.\nA FIFA-inspired windfall tax on pricey video game re-releases could be introduced. If a flat 5% had been imposed on the sale of every copy in the FIFA franchise over the past three decades it would have brought in $970m, roughly equivalent to the cost of building two Emirates Stadium in Holloway. And perhaps provide the funds for fans to go and watch real football in a real (and new) venue. \nTalia Edgerton \nBath \n\nDead souls\nYour article on rereading Russian literature in wartime quoted Oksana Zabuzhko, a Ukrainian writer,  as saying that literature “is of one flesh with the society for which and about which it writes” (“The useful idiot”, October 8th). And Volodymyr Yermolenko, a Ukrainian philosopher, is quoted as saying that Russian literature is full of “imperialist discourse”. It is not clear what is meant by literature being “of one flesh” with a society. It suggests some kind of historical determinism that all authors contribute to. It ignores the fact that Leo Tolstoy was excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox church and that Fyodor Dostoyevsky gave prescient warnings of the evils of Soviet repression. And the question arises whether this is also true of Boris Pasternak, Mikhail Bulgakov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. “The Gulag Archipelago” is more a thorn in the flesh of Soviet society than as one with it.\nThe book challenged the reality and the society it was written in and showed a way to a different possible future rather than predetermining it to be imperialist and repressive. I was glad that The Economist did not fall into that trap and instead pointed to Mikhail Bakhtin’s idea of polyphony.\nErik Cleven\nProfessor of politics\nSaint Anselm College\nManchester, New Hampshire\nI agree that abjuring Dostoyevsky’s novels may be counterproductive. For example, when Dmitri Karamazov (hours after bashing in his childhood care-giver’s head) tries to goad his paramour’s suitor into toasting Russia, the Polish officer offers a defiant “To Russia within her borders before 1772.” Reading that riposte today feels far more poignant than, say, ten years ago. \nAlex Dew\nSalt Lake City\n\nExploring the brain\nYour Technology Quarterly highlighted the research potential in neurosciences (September 24th). But it overlooked the yawning gap between treatments that already exist and what is actually available for those who need them. \nEpilepsy affects more than 50m people worldwide. The least expensive anti-seizure medications cost less than $6 a year, for treatment that can enable 70% of people with epilepsy to live seizure free. But that figure drops to about 50% in middle-income countries and 20% in low-resource countries. Harmful myths about epilepsy, widespread discrimination that is often enshrined in law, and a lack of global attention have turned a highly treatable brain disorder into a condition that deprives sufferers of their human rights and kills at a rate three times higher than the general population.\nIn May 2022 at the World Health Assembly, a ten-year global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders was unanimously approved by member states. The high health, economic and psychosocial burden of epilepsy was recognised and targets to increase awareness, replace discriminatory laws and expand epilepsy services were set. Research and technology can deepen our understanding and increase future options for people with epilepsy. But now is the time to act and at least make available what has already proved to be effective and already exists. \nJ. Helen Cross\nPresident\nInternational League Against Epilepsy\nFlower Mound, Texas\nFrancesca Sofia\nPresident\nInternational Bureau for Epilepsy\nWashington, DC\n\nChina’s educational edge\nThe briefing analysing the competition in innovation between America and China went into considerable detail (“Mothering invention”, October 15th) but never mentioned the fact that PISA testing of 15-year-old high-school students around the world in 2018 found that American students were about four years behind their Chinese peers in math, three years behind in science, and almost two years behind in language skills. That’s a very important factor. \nYou also pointed out that although 60% of the best researchers in artificial intelligence are in America, a quarter of them are Chinese. These levels will probably decrease because fewer Chinese are now studying in America and the proportion of China’s “sea turtles” returning home after studying in America has been rising. Not to mention China phobia in America. Meanwhile, China’s universities are improving. Tsinghua University is now reportedly a match for MIT.\nLoyd Eskildson\nFormer chief deputy superintendent\nMaricopa County School Superintendent Office\nPhoenix\n\nItaly responds\nReading The Economist is a pleasure for every diplomat. And, as the Italian ambassador to Britain, even more so since you dedicate constant attention to Italy, so much loved by the British people. Such is the case with your latest cover on “Britaly” (October 22nd), unfortunately inspired by the oldest of stereotypes. Although spaghetti and pizza are the most sought after foods in the world, for your next cover we suggest you pick from our aerospace, biotech, automotive or pharmaceutical industries to depict my country. Whatever the choice, it would cast a more accurate spotlight on Italy, and take into account your not-so-secret admiration for our economic model.\nInigo Lambertini\nAmbassador for Italy\nLondon\nIn your leader, “Welcome to Britaly”, you compare Liz Truss to Larry the cat: “living in Downing Street but wielding no power”. This is an unfair and insulting comparison. Larry the cat has gone above and beyond his duties as chief mouser. He has full control over who comes and goes into 10 Downing Street, be it cats, urban foxes, pigeons, or Donald Trump. He has generated more positive pr for the office than any of his four former housemates. He deserves your apology (and a can of tuna).\ndara nikolova\nLuxembourg","description":"A selection of correspondence","articleDescription":"A selection of
