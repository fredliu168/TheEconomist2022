the air no more than ten minutes when its single engine sputtered and began losing power. Richard Leakey ramped up the fuel mixture, cutting the air intake—a mistake at that altitude. Unable to restart the engine, he found himself free-falling towards villages and schools. There were children below, waving at the plane as it came closer. He also had four passengers on board, all workers at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), where he was director. More than himself, he had to save all those folk.\nSpying a nearby cattle field, he tried to descend in a gentle glide, but one of the wings struck the edge of a sprawling mango tree. As the nose hit the ground, the engine was thrust back into the cockpit and his ankles folded up against his sharp-snapped legs. It was an injury known as “pilot’s foot”.\n\nHis chronic impatience was epitomised by that crash. Pig-headedly, and against advice, he never wore boots while flying his plane. That morning he had ordered his staff to fly with him instead of travelling, as planned, by road; no time to lose. Nor did he agree that the accident was pilot error and mechanical failure, as the Cessna engineers concluded. To him it was clearly sabotage for political reasons, an attempt to get him out of the way. Facts were inconvenient in such a good story.\nAs for his legs, after the medics had amputated his left below the knee and told him that his right foot would need a year more to heal, he ordered the surgeon to cut that off, too. When his prosthetic limbs arrived, he learned to walk in just three days. His doctors had said it would take a fortnight.\nImpatience was a family trait: an odd one, since the Leakeys’ speciality was humanity’s deep history. At 23, having dropped out of school, he went behind his father’s back and persuaded the National Geographic Society, his father’s funders, to provide $25,000 for a fossil-hunting expedition to what is now Lake Turkana, in northern Kenya. In 1969 his team unearthed a cache of primitive tools and two skulls there. One was an Australopithecus, an ape-like creature some palaeontologists call “near-man”.\nThe discovery established Kenya as a great new source of fossils. It also made him, at 25, the head of all Kenya’s museums, and pitched him into one of the fiercest debates in science. He believed that man, with his large brain and tool-making ability, went back 3m years. His biggest rival, Donald Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley, California, thought they were much more recent and that his own discovery in Ethiopia, Australopithecus afarensis (known as “Lucy”) was the ancestor of all hominids. In 1981, on American TV, he and Dr Johanson went mano a mano. Dr Johanson, with a felt-tip pen, drew his linear version of man’s family tree; he, in reply, scrawled an X through it and put beside it a huge, dramatic question-mark. Eventually he was proved right: early apes were more diverse than many realised, and the human family tree had many branches too, including ones that cross-pollinated.\nAltogether the Leakey team was to find more than 10,000 fossils at Lake Turkana. As team leader he naturally called himself Dr Leakey, though as a palaeontologist he was self-taught and chippy about his lack of academic credentials. It was his wife Meave whose diligence gave the family enterprise its scientific heft. His own forte was to see the larger picture. Asked once if he would help raise funds for an independent research centre at Lake Turkana, he instantly said he would, as long as he could build it big.\nHe had big ambitions for conservation, too. When, one April morning in 1989, he heard that President Daniel arap Moi had appointed him as the new head of Kenya’s wildlife department, he knew he had got the job by publicly criticising the management of the country’s national parks and the government’s flabby response to poaching. Moi, in effect, was throwing down the gauntlet to see if “Dr Leakey” could do any better.\nHe could. With characteristic speed he dismantled the corrupt and dispirited department he had inherited, sacking nearly 1,700 layabouts, appointing 40 senior staff on decent dollar-pegged salaries and creating what one colleague called “the most radical institution in Africa”. He tackled the ivory trade not by selling Kenya’s confiscated stash but by burning it in a flaming pyre that made front pages round the world. The World Bank and other donors were so impressed that they approved nearly $150m in loans that were ring-fenced for KWS’s use alone. When anyone complained, he went straight to the president.\nFor some it was all too much, too fast. He was accused of liking animals more than people, and of favouring certain tribes over others. His “shoot-to-kill” policy against poachers revolted many in the West who otherwise supported him. In 1994, after the plane crash, he resigned. He made a spirited foray into party politics afterwards, but it ground too slow for him.\nUnder the acacia\nHe spent his last months in his usual rush, trying to raise money for a $100m museum of humankind to be built on his own land. The more he thought about it, the bigger he wanted it to be, a grand gesture to symbolise Africa’s importance in the human story. Not only would it explore evolution, but also arts and science. It would include a think-tank where Africans could meet and sit at high table with the best Western minds. But American philanthropists, always among his keenest backers, sat on their hands.\nThere would be time to rest, he liked to say, when the Grim Reaper caught up with him. He had outwitted him several times before. When at last he failed to, he was buried at his home on the edge of the Great Rift Valley. He faced south, towards one of the sites where his father had first found proof that human beings walked out of Africa to settle the rest of the Earth. Not ten feet from his grave, buried under the same acacia tree, were the limbs he had lost to impatience so many years before. ■","description":"The palaeoanthropologist and conservationist died on
