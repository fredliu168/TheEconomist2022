In Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health, the justices returned the issue of abortion to the states. In NY State Rifle \u0026 Pistol Ass’n v Bruen, the court clipped states’ power to regulate gun ownership while strengthening gun rights under the second amendment. In both decisions the justices emphasised how important text and history were to proper constitutional interpretation. They also suggested that policy concerns should have no place in their deliberations. \nIn Dobbs the majority argued that because the right to terminate a pregnancy had not been protected by the states in 1868 when the 14th amendment was ratified, the court could not protect the right today. In Bruen, the majority said that to uphold a gun-safety law, it is not enough for the government to show a public interest in the law; states must show their regulations are “consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation”.\nThe justices decided both cases in 6-3 votes along partisan lines. In these cases and others, the court ignored or cherry-picked salient text and history. That suggests that ideology, not an “originalist” interpretation of law, dictated the results.\nAlthough the right to an abortion was not protected in 1868, the same is true for a host of other rights, including adults’ freedom to control their own bodies and to refuse unwanted medical treatment. Yet the court has held that these and other liberties are fundamental rights. Why single out abortion for contempt? The majority said no other implied rights involved the life of an “unborn human being”. But the value judgement that the fetus is worthy of state protection because it is an unborn human being cannot be gleaned from either text or history. That conclusion is, despite the court’s protestations, a policy judgement implicitly held by the court which trumps a woman’s right to control her own body.\nSimilarly in Bruen the court failed to recognise that constitutional litigation regularly involves the balancing of values, including gun safety, and that a purely historical approach is inconsistent with the court’s own jurisprudence. Federal limits on the private ownership of arms such as nuclear weapons would be upheld by the justices whatever the history of that issue might be. In a famous article in the Harvard Law Review from 1989, Erwin Chemerinsky, then at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California, explained that justices must balance the government’s asserted interest in a law with the importance of the right asserted by the plaintiff. Today Mr Chemerinsky’s words are falling on deaf ears. \nIn addition to the abortion and gun cases decided last term, the Supreme Court also resolved two important religion cases. In neither did it rely on text or history; in both, ideology and values played the most significant role in the majority opinions. \nIn Kennedy v Bremerton School District the court, in another 6-3 split, held that a football coach who prayed immediately after a football game while he was still responsible for his players could not be punished by the school district that employed him. The Republican-appointed justices said—without any analysis of history or original meaning—that the first amendment’s free-exercise clause gave the coach the right to pray while on official duty. \nIn the 32-page majority opinion only the faintest nod to history could be found. But 20 of the opinion’s pages were devoted to parsing, and often distorting, the court’s own precedents. For example, the court departed from prior cases that prohibited states and school districts from allowing teacher- or coach-sponsored prayer during official events. Instead it twisted judgments in its prior cases to reach the opposite conclusion in this one.\nThere was similarly no analysis of history in the majority opinion in Carson v Makin, in which the conservative justices required the state of Maine to fund the religious education of children in sparsely populated districts that lacked public high schools.\nIn both religion cases, the dissents made compelling arguments that the justices should have upheld the local decisions as good-faith attempts by state officials to comply with the first amendment’s establishment clause. In both cases the court seemed to reject that argument based on the ideological values of the Republican-appointed justices. \nIn virtually all constitutional cases that reach the Supreme Court, the constitutional text will be too vague or imprecise to dictate a result. The history behind the text will be either irrelevant to the question presented or contested enough to allow a conclusion for either party. Just look at the two-and-a-half-page, single-spaced footnote 48 in Dobbs, which Justice Alito called a “partial list” of important cases where the court overturned itself on major constitutional questions. This footnote shows that it has reversed course in nearly every area of litigated constitutional law—even though neither the relevant text nor history had changed. What changed was the people sitting on the court.\nThe justices should stop pretending that text and history determine the results of important constitutional cases. As last term clearly demonstrated, America’s highest court decides the biggest and most divisive cases based on personal values and politics. In the name of transparency in government, the Supreme Court should stop pretending its decisions are based on anything else. \nHow to reform the court is a topic of frenzied discussion in the press and in academia. Most calls to do so come from the left because liberals dislike the results being handed down by these ultra-conservative justices. But the court needs reform not because it is too conservative, but because no democracy should give its highest judges life tenure and then ask them to interpret a hopelessly imprecise written constitution that is over two centuries old and virtually impossible to amend (it takes supermajorities in both Congress and state legislatures to do so). \nAmerica should end life tenure for its justices. It should also reconsider the overly influential role the court plays in its democracy. Supreme courts of all political persuasions have used text and history as rhetorical devices to mask the imposition of personal judgments. Perhaps one of these days, an American president should not obey one of the court’s more outlandish and unjustifiable decisions. Or Congress should use its substantial powers under Article III of the constitution to take away some of the court’s jurisdiction over important issues. These and other ideas for reform were considered by a blue-ribbon commission appointed by Mr Biden last year; little came of its lengthy report. Through whatever method, it is well past time to save America from a runaway Supreme Court. ■\nEric Segall is the Ashe Family Chair Professor of Law at Georgia State University.
