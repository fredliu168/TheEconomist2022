Lula, as he is known, won 50.9% of the votes to Mr Bolsonaro’s 49.1%, the narrowest winning margin since Brazil’s return to democracy in the 1980s. After the result was declared, Mr Bolsonaro refused to speak publicly for 45 hours. He eventually gave a two-minute speech and said he would comply with the constitution.

Although Mr Bolsonaro did not explicitly concede, his chief of staff said that the transition of power would proceed smoothly.

 home secretary, Suella Braverman, faced more controversy over immigration. Ms Braverman referred to migrants who  illegally as an “invasion”, as figures revealed that 40,000 have made the dangerous trip so far this year. That is already 40% more than in all of 2021, and up from 300 in 2018.
