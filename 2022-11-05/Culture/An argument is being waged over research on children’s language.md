The findings of a recent study from the Bofill Foundation, an education think-tank in Barcelona, were both obvious and surprising. It showed that children whose parents read with them had a clear advantage over those whose parents did not—a learning gap equivalent to about half a year’s schooling. That is the obvious part: if you read to your children it helps them read, too. But researchers also found that, contrary to popular opinion, supervising children’s homework is not particularly helpful. More useful is setting a regular place and time for them to do their studies. 
What is most startling is how many academics reject such research in principle. A cadre of academic linguists argues that studies into children’s learning often exhibit a “deficit ideology”. Paul Gorski, the founder of the Equity Literacy Institute and a populariser of the term, summarised the idea as “a worldview that explains and justifies outcome inequalities—standardised test scores or levels of educational attainment, for example—by pointing to supposed deficiencies within disenfranchised individuals and communities.” 
In short, deficit ideology gives credence to the idea that poor people are poor because they are doing something wrong. Often, Mr Gorski said, the blame is placed on parents and supposed inadequacies “in the rearing and home lives of low-income students”. He and other critics argue that such academic research ignores the structural factors which make advancement difficult.
The critics have a point: because of prejudice, students can be unfairly thought deficient. Studies have shown that teachers may have different perceptions of their pupils’ academic aptitude based on their race; some may unconsciously mark down work by black pupils. Other factors that should be irrelevant, such as , can make teachers think pupils are less able than they actually are. 
Students who speak in a minority dialect, such as , are often disparaged for having a poor grasp of standard English grammar. In fact, analyses have shown that they have mastered a different grammar, one that is as complex, intricate and expressive in its own way. The child is not at fault. The system to teach them skills in standard English is.
Critics of deficit ideology are further backed up by the fact that research may be misinterpreted by a simplistic press. Journalists should beware of describing academic findings as though they are irrefutable or suggesting that tentative correlations are magic solutions. A study in 1995 implied a relationship between the number of words children have heard from parents by the age of three and their academic success at nine. Youngsters from well-off families, it suggested, had heard  than those from poorer ones. But subsequent research has questioned the extent of this “word gap”, whether it varies from place to place—indeed whether it exists at all.
Despite all this, it is still worth researching into children’s learning. One reason is that it is better to know what early interventions might work than to remain in ignorance. The remedy for poorly controlled studies that do not account for pre-existing disadvantages is better research and robust debate, not to dismiss all work on what behaviour might help children develop their language skills merely because such work constitutes a deficit ideology. By all means research inequality and its causes, but also research things that might help fix it.
Every study worth its paper and ink controls for factors such as parents’ levels of education and income—and these controls depend on an acknowledgment of the same inequalities that academics contest. For example, the Bofill Foundation’s report found that socioeconomic status predicted an advantage in school performance, although the gain was not quite as much as that predicted by reading with children, irrespective of social class. 
Research is a vital tool for identifying ways in which all parents, rich or poor, can support their offspring’s learning—such as a regular homework routine. For some parents, its findings may be difficult to put into practice: many understand the importance of reading, but are unable to afford books and live far from a library. Yet even then, studies can help on an institutional level. Gathering evidence about early education can lead policymakers to help by introducing better policies for babies, children and their parents.■
