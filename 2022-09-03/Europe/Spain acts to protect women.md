They called their chat group “the pack”, the five men who raped an 18-year-old woman in a doorway during the San Fermín festival in Pamplona in 2016. They even filmed their crime. But a court in Navarre found them guilty only of “sexual abuse”, a charge well below rape. The judges found that the victim had not physically resisted, and therefore the violence or threat that must accompany the crime was absent. An appeals court agreed. 
Only after an uproar were the men found guilty of rape by Spain’s supreme court. But the tumult did not subside, and the slogan “No means no” gave way to a new one: , “only yes is yes”. Now Spain’s parliament has passed a new law with that at its core: sex without clear consent in word or deed would count as the serious crime of sexual aggression or rape.
Spain joins more than a dozen European countries with affirmative-consent laws. Evidence indicates that they make a difference in reports, charges and convictions. In the first year (2021) of Denmark’s consent law, for example, the number of rape charges brought by police grew by 56%, and those brought to the next stage by prosecutors more than doubled. That is partly because it is easier for a victim to argue that she could not consent (because of shock, say, or a spiked drink) than that she was physically incapable of resistance. But Gyrithe Ulrich, a senior prosecutor, told Denmark’s state broadcaster that fears of kangaroo courts and easy convictions are overblown. The Danish conviction rate in completed rape trials is 60%; for other crimes it is 90%. She reckons that nothing (including the new law) will bring the rape conviction rate that high.
As important as achieving convictions, advocates say, is giving victims a quicker path to recovery. Those who report their rapes to police are also more likely to tell friends and family, get counselling, deal with shame and trauma, and finally return to their personal lives and careers.
That such a law has been passed in the land that gave the world the word machismo should not, in fact, be a surprise. Emilio Lamo, a sociologist, argues that Spain quickly jumped “from the rearguard to the avant-garde” in social affairs, for example being one of the first countries to allow gay marriage. This week the cabinet also considered a law liberalising abortion. It would eliminate three-day waiting periods, allow 16- and 17-year-olds access without parental permission and ensure that no parts of the country are without abortion providers. (Many now are, because of conscience clauses for doctors who object to abortion.) But not everyone in a once heavily Catholic and conservative country has gone along happily with these rapid changes.
Today’s government includes the centre-left Socialists and far-left Podemos. The consent law is the brainchild of Podemos’s Irene Montero, the equality minister, a hate-figure to those on the right. They are correct to spot sweeping ambition in the law, which goes well beyond rape. It bans sharing of someone else’s sexual pictures or videos without consent, and advertising of prostitution. It offers income support to women out of work or on reduced hours because of sexual violence, which can force them to move home or hide. And it will bolster consent-based sex education at all schooling levels. 
The new law also criminalises street harassment. It is likely to hit few perpetrators (it is hard to identify a passing harasser), but is symbolic. A deputy for Vox, a right-wing party, said in May that she would miss the tradition of come-ons like “Tell me your name so I can ask for you for Christmas,” thanks to legislators with “hate for beauty, and for men”. In reply, many women shared stories of frightening street encounters. Spaniards are likely to find that the culture—and the judges—that initially let “the pack” off so lightly will change more slowly than the hard right fears, or than the radical left would like. ■
