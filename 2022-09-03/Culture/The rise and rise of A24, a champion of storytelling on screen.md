“Uncut gems”, a thriller about a jeweller with a gambling addiction, has little in common with “Ramy”, a television series about an Egyptian-American man examining his faith and desires. Likewise, “Euphoria”, a gritty high-school show, is far removed from “The Green Knight”, a feature-length retelling of an Arthurian legend. You might point out that most had a modest budget, or that they were created by emerging writer-directors. But what really connects them is A24, an entertainment company. These stories are alike in their idiosyncrasy—and that is the point. 
A24 was set up ten years ago by David Fenkel, John Hodges and Daniel Katz, all veterans of New York’s independent film business. Mr Katz had worked in film financing at Guggenheim Partners, and the investment and financial-services firm provided a few million dollars in seed money. At first A24 specialised in distribution: ie, it acquired films during production or at festivals, set a release date and worked out a marketing strategy. 
Its executives felt the company could stand out in two ways. First, A24 sought to challenge preconceptions about high-quality storytelling, often synonymous with historical drama and other prestige fare loved by older audiences. It would champion auteurs with unique stories to tell and work that might appeal to young cinephiles. Second, it would rethink how a film was promoted. Rather than relying on established and expensive forms of advertising, such as printed ads, it would think digitally, focusing on social media as the best way to reach its target demographic. 
Industry folk were initially wary of this small upstart. After seeing “Spring Breakers”, a black-comedy crime caper, at the Venice Film Festival in 2012, it took A24 two months to negotiate the distribution deal. One A24 executive flew to Pittsburgh to woo the rights-holder; in a nod to the film’s themes, and to the bemusement of airport security, he took a gift basket including a glass bong shaped like a handgun. Others had doubted whether the film would do well in cinemas; but after A24 arranged a theatrical release, “Spring Breakers” grossed almost $32m—not much by blockbuster standards, but a decent return for an indie film made with a $5m budget.
More successes, and critical acclaim, soon followed. A breakthrough came when “Room” (2015), an adaptation of a novel about a woman and child kept in captivity, won an Academy Award. (To date, films in which A24 has been involved have been nominated for 32 Oscars and won seven.) Ed Guiney, one of the producers of “Room”, says the firm’s executives take an interest in the entire shooting process. They “feel like collaborators, rather than a studio”, he says. “They’re an extension of the film-making team.” Mr Guiney’s company, Element Pictures, has since worked with A24 on projects including the forthcoming “The Eternal Daughter”. 
In late 2014 A24 expanded into production, making “Moonlight” with a budget of $1.5m. After winning the Oscar for Best Picture, it went on to gross more than $65m. The company developed a reputation for masterful horror films, including “Hereditary” and “Midsommar”. It began to have hits on television, and so far has earned 23 Emmy nominations. This year its flagship series, “Euphoria”, averaged 16.3m viewers per episode in America. That makes it hbo’s second-most-popular show of recent decades behind “Game of Thrones”. 
A24 has thus achieved a rare thing: making arthouse or offbeat stories widely popular. Its feat is all the more impressive in an era dominated by behemoth studios churning out remakes and spin-offs. Stephen Follows, a film-industry analyst, has estimated that only 3.4% of the independent films released in America between 1999 and 2018 made a profit. The majority—90%—were never shown in cinemas. 
By contrast, A24 recently propelled “Everything Everywhere All At Once”, a comedy-drama set in the multiverse, to a worldwide box-office take of $100m. It opened in a select number of cinemas, where its reputation grew, before expanding to venues across America. To promote it, A24 released videos riffing on the kooky story. In one of the tale’s universes people have hot dogs for fingers; fans can buy “Hot Dog Finger Gloves” via the A24 shop.
Currently A24 puts out about 25 movies a year, meaning it takes on only what the industry calls “passion projects”. Auteurs like working with it for this reason. Halina Reijn, the director of “Bodies Bodies Bodies”, a new horror-comedy, says it offers “a bed in which you can lay and really play and be yourself, without ever making it feel as if there’s more at stake than just the creativity”. That, she adds, “is a pretty interesting thing—to be able to do that within a system that is also driven by money.” 
The bosses of A24 declined to talk on the record, coyly hoping their output speaks for itself. It has proved persuasive to financiers as well as awards juries. In March the company was valued at $2.5bn as it took in $225m in investment; the lead investor is Stripes, a private-equity firm that helps businesses grow. The funds will let A24 boost its production capacity. It has opened an office in London (and poached two bbc commissioners); it hopes to make films and tv programmes in other territories soon, possibly in foreign languages. 
There is a risk that A24 becomes less discerning as it expands, or that investors nudge it to produce more predictable content. But for now, viewers and film-makers put off by big-studio schlock know where to look for original storytelling. ■
