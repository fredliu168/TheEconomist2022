###### American campaign finance
# Fundraising remains predictive of success in Congressional elections 
##### Democratic Senate candidates are out-raising their opponents in decisive races

Democrats approached the American elections of 2020 hoping to make Joe Biden a president with a big congressional majority. The party’s Senate candidates in Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Montana and South Carolina all raised far more money than their opponents did. Yet all five lost.
At first glance, this suggests that campaign donations fail to predict electoral outcomes. Most studies show that, in general elections for federal offices, money buys few votes directly: once the airwaves are saturated with ads, further spots make little difference. But in the past, data on some contributions—those by individuals, which are limited to $2,900 per candidate-donor pair—have offered precious insight.
When a party’s share of these donations in a state or district has risen from one election to the next, its vote share has tended to increase too. The best explanation is that these funds, unlike those from parties or bundling groups, tend to flow to campaigns with hard-to-measure strengths like candidate quality or voter enthusiasm.
Any weakening of this pattern could explain Democratic Senate candidates’ losses in 2020. In recent years, political-donation websites like ActBlue and WinRed have nationalised campaign finance. In 2020 out-of-state donors accounted for 68% of contributions by individuals, up from 31% in 2012. Such benefactors may never have heard of the recipients of their gifts, and are not eligible to vote for them.
In theory, this could make financial data less useful in revealing a candidate’s strength or weakness. However, if you strip out the impact of other factors that affect donations and voting, the numbers remain informative—even in the ActBlue era.


Most incumbents out-raise their opponents. So do Democrats running in liberal states, and Republicans in conservative ones. Using these trends, we calculated the expected shares of votes and individual donations in each Senate race since 2008. For example, a Republican facing a Democratic incumbent in Florida in 2018 should get 20% of contributions and 46% of votes.
Compared with such benchmarks, good fundraisers have had unusual success. In 2018-20, candidates with donation shares at least 15 percentage points above expectations beat their predicted vote shares by three points on average. In Florida in 2018, Rick Scott, the Republican nominee, got an impressive 40% of donations, and won.


The finding that money still matters should please Democrats, who are once again winning the fundraising wars. It implies that the party’s financial edge reflects real strengths, which were just too small to win the red states it targeted in 2020. This year, Democrats are competing on friendlier terrain: Republican senators are retiring in North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Flipping just one of them would make Democrats likely to hold the Senate.■
