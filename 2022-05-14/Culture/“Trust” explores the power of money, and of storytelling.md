WHO WAS Mildred Bevel? According to Andrew Bevel, a “legendary” Wall Street tycoon, his late wife was gentle, frail and kind, with a taste for pretty music and the “innocent wisdom” of a child. But in a thinly veiled novel about her life, published soon after her death in the mid-1930s, she shimmers as a brilliant loner and astute philanthropist who dies of madness in a Swiss sanatorium.

Who gets to tell Mildred’s story now that she is not around to tell it for herself? How accurate are any of the stories people tell about themselves and others anyway? These questions animate “Trust”, Hernan Diaz’s clever puzzle of a new novel.
As he demonstrated in 2017 with “In the Distance”, a debut which chronicled the rough and tumble of 19th-century America through the eyes of a young Swede with no English, Mr Diaz is not afraid to disorientate readers. In “Trust” he creates a kind of narrative matryoshka doll, nesting what may be the truth about Mildred within obfuscating layers of story.
He begins with a novel within the novel about a childless couple who live contentedly amid obscene wealth—“the obvious Dutch oil paintings, the constellations of French chandeliers, the Chinese vases mushrooming in every corner”—until the wife’s grip on reality starts to slip, “the mind becoming the flesh for its own teeth”. This detached, third-person yarn, reminiscent of the work of Henry James, is followed by a somewhat bombastic autobiography-in-progress by Bevel. He touts the patriotism of his enormous success, maintaining that “self-interest, if properly directed, need not be divorced from the common good”. Then there is a memoir from a writer called Ida Partenza who helped Bevel sculpt his legacy in print. Finally come some unpublished pages, seemingly by Mildred herself.
The title is a nod to Bevel’s wealth. But it also evokes the fragile feeling that is frequently missing from relationships, including between storytellers and audiences. As Bevel gamely admits, self- interest nudges people to “bend and align reality” to accord with needs or desires.
“Trust” dramatises the way such truth-bending often accompanies tales of wealth. “What I’ve made, I’ve made on my own,” says Bevel, who inherited a fortune. The novel also highlights the way history’s dominant storytellers—mostly white and male—have tended to sideline the narratives of others, such as women. As Partenza writes of her affinity with Mildred: “We both were young women trying to grow in narrow crevices, hoping to break and expand them in the process.”
Mr Diaz shifts elegantly between styles, but saves the most engaging voices for the novel’s second half. Partenza’s memories of being cowed by Bevel’s money and authority, and her nostalgia for her “overbearing and dysfunctional” father, inject depth, momentum and clarity. The only shame is Mr Diaz’s pat ending, which gives too much of the game away. ■
