# The shameful statelessness of South-East Asia’s sea nomads 
##### Some 1m water-dwellers are citizens of nowhere

ON THE FLOOR of a hut perched over the shallows off the island of Pulau Gaya the head of the household, Bilbayati, sits cross-legged, surrounded by a flock of grandchildren, fingering an official-looking piece of paper. The notice informs him of the recent death of his son, Aminrati, the family breadwinner, in a hospital on the other side of Sabah, the Malaysian state occupying the northern portion of Borneo. He had been taken ill with blood poisoning and died.
The death notice is the first time that Aminrati has assumed a documented identity, an irony not lost on Bilbayati (not his real name). Father and son hail from a set of indigenous groups who live on boats or in villages of stilt-houses connected by rickety walkways, spread along the coasts of Borneo, the Sulu archipelago in the southern Philippines, and the islands of eastern Indonesia.
The groups, who number perhaps 1m members, have historically made a living from fishing and diving for shells and sea cucumbers. They go by a welter of different names. The most common is Bajau, though this is an exonym; many refer to themselves as Sama. In English they are often called “sea nomads”.
To scientists, Sama-Bajau are notable for their larger spleens full of oxygen-bearing blood, evolved for staying underwater for longer. To themselves, by far their most notable feature is their statelessness. Though they have plied the region’s seas for centuries, they are not citizens of any adjacent country. 
Their statelessness dates back to those countries’ founding. Nation-statism relies on a well-documented citizenry within hard borders. Sama-Bajau transgress on both counts. Documentation is not essential for boat-dwellers in a damp environment—even today most are illiterate. As for borders, the seascape which was their home did not recognise them. When newly decolonised states hammered their borders and their citizens in place, Sama-Bajau, lacking even informal land title ashore, were suspect. Worse, in officials’ eyes, how could you vouch for these sea-wanderers’ loyalty? They were denied citizenship.
For those living in Sabah today, the effects of statelessness are profound. Medical treatment in Malaysia is nearly free to citizens. But as a “foreigner”, even though he was born in Sabah, Bilbayati now owes the hospital 4,000 ringgit ($854) for his late son’s admission. Bajau children are denied state schooling. On tiny Omadal island in north-east Sabah, Jefri Musa runs a stilt-house school for 34 Bajau kids, supported by an NGO, in the teeth of bureaucratic resistance. But even educated Sama-Bajau, he says, face discrimination when they look for work. Many work as porters or end up begging in quayside markets.
The stilt-villages lack even the most basic public services. The mildly tidal waters under them, in which children constantly play, are an open sewer. Infections are common. Infant mortality is high. In Omadal Mr Musa’s school has instituted a vaccination programme. Very occasionally, state doctors visit the settlements, accompanied by policemen. The doctors complain that the ignorant villagers simply vanish, uninterested in better health.
Yet their evasion is perfectly rational. Bitter experience teaches Sama-Bajau not to engage with the authorities unless strictly necessary. Unscrupulous officials prey upon their desire for legality, often demanding bribes for temporary permits and passes. Worse, Sama-Bajau face arbitrary incarceration, including in camps for illegal migrants. When police visited Omadal in search of a stolen boat, the father of one of Mr Musa’s students instinctively fled. The police shot at him and threw him in jail, even though the boat was found elsewhere.
Sama-Bajau are kicked out of their traditional fishing grounds as marine parks are designated for tourism. After armed men from Sulu attacked eastern Sabah in 2013, claiming it was part of a historical Sulu sultanate, Malaysia imposed a curfew in Sabah waters, harming Bajau fishermen. Sanen Marshall, a political scientist, says his friends complain that the marine police often throw their fishing rods overboard.
Things are not about to get easier for the sea nomads. As contesting countries, China above all, press maritime and territorial claims in the South China Sea, frontiers are growing more militarised. That leaves the waters’ original peoples washed up. To some, the Sama-Bajau’s plight is a cost of preserving borders. In truth, their stateless condition in Malaysia is a national disgrace.
