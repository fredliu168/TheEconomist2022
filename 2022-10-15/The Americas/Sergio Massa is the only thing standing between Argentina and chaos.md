Walk down Calle Lavalle or Calle Florida in the centre of Buenos Aires and every 20 metres someone will call out “” (exchange), offering to buy dollars at a rate that is roughly double the official one. In supermarkets prices rise every month. Inflation this year is heading for 100%. As it has been several times in the past 50 years Argentina is once again lost in an economic labyrinth mainly of its own making. The distortions have reached danger point. “If this carries on, we’ll see looting of supermarkets again,” says a taxi driver.
At the root of the current instability is a weak and divided Peronist government. Alberto Fernández, the president, owes his job to the decision by Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (no relation), Peronism’s most powerful figure, to pick him as the Peronist candidate and to run herself to be his vice-president. They inherited an economy that their conservative predecessor, Mauricio Macri, had tried, but failed, to fix. He reached a $57bn agreement with the IMF to avert disaster. Mr Fernández’s first finance minister, Martín Guzmán, an academic, expanded price and exchange controls, restructured foreign bonds and negotiated a new accord with the IMF. 
The fund was more lenient than in the past. Even so, to make the economy viable the agreement requires Argentina to cut the fiscal deficit and the printing of money by the Central Bank to finance the government, and to shore up international reserves. Preferring inflation to austerity, Ms Fernández’s allies in Congress voted against the accord, which was approved with the votes of moderate Peronists and the opposition. When Mr Guzmán tried to implement it, she forced him out in July. That prompted the peso in the street to plunge; demand for the government’s peso bonds dried up. With protests and strikes growing, some feared the government might fall.
The Fernándezes reluctantly turned to Sergio Massa, a third important figure in Peronism, who moved from presiding over the lower house of Congress to heading a beefed up economy ministry. He has brought some calm, albeit not much. His aims, he told Bello in his office in Buenos Aires, are to get inflation down both by cutting the fiscal deficit and by building confidence in the peso with a trade surplus and foreign reserves. “The IMF agreement is an anchor, not an objective,” he says. “It’s useful as a route map.”
Mr Massa brought in reserves by the expedient of offering soya farmers a better exchange rate to repatriate their dollars. Even so, net reserves are only $2bn, according to the IMF. To husband them as Argentine fans prepare to travel to Qatar for next month’s football World Cup, he has introduced a tax on tourist spending abroad. He has reduced government outlays, drawn up a stricter budget and is working on cutting indiscriminate subsidies of utility bills and public transport. Inflation has helped that effort by cutting the real value of spending. The minister got a boost when the IMF on October 7th approved a disbursement of $3.8bn (though the money will go back to it in debt repayment). The fund praised Mr Massa’s efforts but warned that risks remain high. 
The biggest of those dangers is political. Ms Fernández tweeted that the government should do more to moderate food prices; her son, Máximo, a congressman, sniped at the “soya dollar”. Yet Ms Fernández must know that Mr Massa is the only thing standing between Argentina and chaos. The country faces a general election in a year, which the opposition is widely expected to win. Thoroughgoing reform of the economy and a return to sustained growth will have to wait for a stronger and more determined government. For the current one “the aim is to survive, because they don’t govern,” says Luis Tonelli, a political scientist who is close to the opposition. Facing legal charges for corruption (which she claims are political persecution), Ms Fernández has an interest in being re-elected as a senator to retain immunity from imprisonment.
Mr Massa is a rival as well as an ally. Aged 50, he is widely thought to have presidential ambitions. He harks back to the conservative strand in Peronism that governed in the 1990s under Carlos Menem but was then marginalised by Ms Fernández’s leftist populism. Fail, and he will be simply a footnote in the government’s wider failure. Do too well, and Ms Fernández may cut him down. But Mr Massa at least has a modest opportunity to slow the deterioration in Argentina’s plight. Do so, and he will have made a name for himself for the future.
