GIVEN ITS history, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) was predestined for reinvention. It started life in 1698 as a list of prices stuck to the wall of a back-alley coffee house; a hundred years later, it was hosting three-quarters of the world’s stockmarket. By the turn of the 21st century the roar of open-outcry trading had been replaced by the hum of mainframes. On March 15th the LSE announced its next transformation: into an exchange for private companies as well as listed ones.
The new bourse will be a partnership with Floww, a database for private firms and venture-capital (VC) funds in which the LSE’s parent company has bought a minority stake. Floww was designed to connect startups to potential investors by enabling them to share commercial data in a standard, easily verifiable form. The LSE intends to take that model two steps further. First it will turn the database into a platform on which companies can raise capital by selling equity stakes to VC funds. Then it will add a secondary marketplace where investors can trade the resulting shares—thus helping startups attract investors in the first place.

Similarities with how public-equity markets work are no coincidence. Murray Roos, the head of capital markets at the LSE’s parent company, wants it to be a step towards creating exchanges that are “genuinely indifferent as to whether a company is public or private”. Then private firms would be able to raise capital on a standardised exchange rather than in VC investment rounds, which happen behind closed doors. He envisages a “funding continuum” that would ease private firms’ eventual transition to public markets.
An exchange for private equity would be good for investors, too, because the market for unlisted firms has grown more important in recent years. In 2021 private-equity investors struck deals worth a record-breaking $1.1trn globally. VC funds accounted for a further $621bn. Onerous reporting obligations for listed firms have led to companies staying private for longer, growing all the while. That delays the moment when most investors can buy in, denying them a larger share of the wealth successful companies generate. At first the new exchange will target institutional buyers, but the end goal is to redress the balance by allowing retail investors in too.
Another, unspoken, aim of the partnership is to help revive Britain’s flagging stockmarket. Other platforms also allow investors to trade the shares of unlisted companies, from the market for private shares run by Nasdaq to British “crowdfunders” such as Seedrs. But the LSE is the first to try to integrate such an offering into its infrastructure of data analytics, regulatory reporting, settlement and clearing.
The hope is that the private firms joining the new exchange will be more likely to list in London when they go public. A boost is sorely needed. In 2005 the City hosted 20% of the world’s initial public offerings; by 2021 that had fallen to 4%. The loss in 2016 of Arm Holdings, one of Britain’s most successful tech companies, to SoftBank, a Japanese investment giant, dealt a double blow. The firm, which has its headquarters in Cambridge, is now set to return to public markets, but looks likely to choose Nasdaq over the LSE.
Reviving the City is a task that the LSE cannot succeed in alone. Its exchange in Paternoster Square is merely the focal point of Britain’s stockmarket, not the whole system. It is surrounded by pension schemes and retail investors who are buying fewer British shares than ever, too few research analysts capable of covering tech firms, and too many fund managers uninterested in growth equity. “The problem with the LSE isn’t its tech or its programs, which are very innovative,” says Hussein Kanji, a venture capitalist in London. The real issue is that it “attracts an old-fashioned institutional base that doesn’t fully comprehend the new economy”. ■
