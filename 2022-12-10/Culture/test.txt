By Philip Coggan. Profile Books; 208 pages; £14.99. To be published in America by Pegasus Books in July; $26.95\nOur former Bartleby columnist takes a wry look at the changing world of work, covering everything from automation to presenteeism. He skewers corporate jargon and a range of management fads, and proposes various new laws of his own—such as “80% of the time of 80% of people in a meeting is wasted”, and “jargon abhors a vacuum”. \n Backfire. By Agathe Demarais. Columbia University Press; 304 pages; $30 and £25\nA look at the ripple effects of American sanctions by the global forecasting director of the Economist Intelligence Unit, who used to work for the French Treasury in Russia and Lebanon. It highlights sanctions’ unexpected side-effects—and their potential to backfire, as in the case of recent American controls on semiconductor exports to China. “Illuminating”, reckoned International Affairs; “balanced, fast-paced and often surprising”, said the Wall Street Journal.\nMoney in One Lesson. By Gavin Jackson. Pan Macmillan; 400 pages; $24.95 and £18.99\nOne of our economics and finance correspondents answers the important questions on the nature of money and the ways it shapes the world. The book draws on historical examples to dispel myths and show how societies and their citizens have always been entwined with matters of lucre. “A lucid and at times very funny history of money”, concluded the Financial Times.\nStrength In Numbers. By G. Elliott Morris. W.W. Norton; 224 pages; $28.95 and £21.99\nOne of our data journalists reflects on the history of polls, showing how they not only predict the outcomes of elections but improve democracy. Polling, he argues, is a way for citizens to have influence they otherwise would not. “A short, valuable guide”, said the Guardian. “Political junkies and policy analysts will savour this informative deep dive,” thought Publishers Weekly.\nThe Economist Explains: Oddly Informative Matters of Fact that Amaze and Delight. Edited by Tom Standage. Profile Books; 256 pages; £9.99\nA compendium of the extraordinary quandaries and conundrums, bizarre facts and head-scratchers featured in our popular “The Economist Explains” series of articles.
