 began  its “zero-covid” policy, which was struggling to contain the Omicron variant and had become a source of widespread frustration. The state will no longer force people with mild cases to enter government-run quarantine centres. They can now isolate at home.

As Russia pounded  with more missiles, aiming to knock out critical infrastructure as winter deepens, Ukraine struck back. Two large explosions were reported at a pair of Russian air bases several hundred kilometres from the border.

Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that the price cap set by the G7 and EU on  was too high to inflict real damage on the Russian economy and called for tougher action. The allies have imposed a cap of $60 a barrel, about the same as the price paid anyway for oil pumped from the Urals. 
 media regulator ordered TV Rain, an independent Russian channel that operates from Latvia, to shut down. TV Rain was fined for depicting Crimea as part of Russia and criticised for being too sympathetic to Russian conscript troops. It says it is against the war.

 prime minister-designate, Binyamin Netanyahu, clinched the support of enough parties in the Knesset to form a government. The emerging coalition is likely to include two far-right parties, including one led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, who may get a newly created post as national security minister.
China’s leader, Xi Jinping, arrived in  to meet the leaders of the kingdom and a string of bigwigs from across the Arab world.  that China, which is investing heavily in the Gulf, is seeking to displace it as the region’s key partner. 
Meanwhile, an American federal court dismissed a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, , who had been accused of ordering the murder of a Saudi dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, in 2018. It said he had immunity as a head of government, a decision that came as a relief to the American administration. 
 military rulers reached a deal with pro-democracy leaders to establish a civilian-led government that will manage a transition to democracy. A previous power-sharing agreement struck after a coup in 2019 fell apart after a second putsch last year.
 president, Cyril Ramaphosa, asked the country’s highest court to  of a panel appointed by Parliament, which alleged enough evidence of misconduct to consider impeaching him. The panel was investigating the source of at least $580,000 that had been hidden in, and then stolen from, his sofa.

Raphael Warnock held on to a Senate seat in  for the Democrats in a run-off election. His victory means the party will have a 51-49 advantage in the Senate when Congress convenes in January.

The disruption may spread further, as the cost-of-living crisis bites and more unions reject below-inflation pay deals. 
It is not just Britain that is experiencing a winter of discontent. Staff at the  rejected a pay offer that fell well short of inflation and are considering industrial action. The ECB is at least consistent. It has argued in favour of pay restraint to keep inflation subdued.
