# Protest movements as deadly as Iran’s often end in revolution or civil war

Beyond their remarkable bravery, little is known for certain about the protesters who have thronged Iranian streets in recent months. Amid internet blackouts and harsh repression, external observers seeking to study the demonstrations have to rely on news articles, reports by human-rights groups and social-media posts.
Yet when compiled methodically, even such fragmentary sources can offer clues about the movement’s evolution and fate. Since 1997 the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (acled), a research group, has collected information on political unrest. Its records cover 1.6m events, like protests or battles, in 130,000 places.
Iran’s rulers claim without evidence that foreign governments are behind the unrest. acled’s data show that the movement is too broad for this to be credible. Protests have persisted for months, and reached all over the country. Although episodes of this scale do not always lead to regime change, they do tend to foreshadow even greater political turmoil. Iran has not seen the degree of unrest that often follows such protests since its revolution in 1979.


The movement began on September 16th, when Mahsa Amini, whom Iran’s morality police had arrested for wearing her headscarf “improperly”, died in their custody. Iranians flocked to the streets, calling for “women, life, freedom”. The government and affiliated thugs responded with force, including gunshots and beatings.
The regime has also suppressed news about the protests, jailing journalists and blocking internet access. Only reports that evade these obstacles enter acled’s archive, often weeks after events occurred. As a result, its counts of protests and deaths are lower bounds, not final tallies.
The data show that violence peaked early in the uprising. At least one person died in 46 of the 213 protests logged in the first week. The worst event was a march on September 30th, in which protesters sought justice for a girl allegedly raped by a police chief. According to acled, police opened fire and killed 97 “marchers and rioters”.
Since then, the share of protests recorded as deadly has fallen from 22% to 5%. Reporting delays may account for some of this, and security forces may be exercising more restraint. But the decline in deaths does not mean that the movement is ebbing. Since November 16th acled has logged at least one protest every day and a daily average of 16, only slightly below the 23 per day from October 1st to November 15th.
Because acled began studying Iran in 2015, its archive does not cover previous episodes of unrest in the country. The current recorded death toll of 322 dwarfs calculations by other sources of fatalities during the Green Movement protests in 2009, at around 30. It is of a similar scale to one estimate of deaths in early 1979, as the overthrow of the shah drew near.


The data also make the protests look relatively bloody when compared with unrest elsewhere. Such analyses are imprecise: the level of detail in acled’s numbers varies from place to place, and demonstrations differ in scale and danger. However, protests in which people die are relatively rare, and especially likely to be reported.
Among all movements in acled’s data, the Iranian uprising is the third-worst 90-day period measured by the number of deadly protests, and sixth by total deaths at protests. On a per-person basis, excluding countries with populations below 10m, it ranks eighth in both. This should make Iran’s rulers nervous. Among the top ten cases in each category, around half have ended in revolution, coups or civil war.■
