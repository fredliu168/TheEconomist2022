FROM Louis Vuitton to Hermès, France’s luxury brands proudly ooze their quintessential Frenchness. But in many other industries French firms seek to disguise their national origins. AXA, a French insurer, chose a name that means nothing and can be pronounced in all languages. GDF Suez, a French energy firm, renamed itself Engie, a word that apparently “evokes energy…in all cultures”. Now a nation forged through a common language, which it doggedly strives to defend, is taking such linguistic mangling to another level. 
In recent years the country has succumbed to the meaningless globish beloved of startups the world over. Among its own firms are Mirakl, a French software firm, or Lunchr, which operates a smartcard for meal vouchers (and recently rebranded itself Swile, although to an English ear that sounds like a mixture of swill and bile). A greater delight is France’s fondness for brands composed of phonetic misspellings of its own phrases. Kiloutou, which in French sounds like  or “who hires everything”, rents out diggers and mechanical equipment. Kinougarde, a play on (“who looks after us”), is a child-care service. Recently the group that owns Buffalo Grill, a restaurant chain which describes itself as “”, renamed itself Napaqaro, which in French () sounds like “checked table-cloth”.
The latest trend is to apply this phonetic play to English words, which may themselves be unfamiliar, but become even more so in the French rendering. New French brands include Izipizi, a fashionable chain of spectacles which to the English ear sounds like “easy-peasy”. Another is Yomoni, an online investor that sounds like “your money”. Then there is Heetch, a ride-hailing service that sounds as if a French person is saying “hitch”. It is unclear whether the French grasp the English resonance. 
To the guardians of linguistic purity all this is an affront. The Académie Française, established by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635, still rules on which foreign words are acceptable. It currently disapproves, for example, of “millennials” in favour of , or “dry January” to which it prefers . The Académie does not pronounce, however, on brand names. Unless it is a matter of silk scarves or designer handbags, France’s ambition to appear on trend globally will mean the ongoing mutilation of its own language, as well as English—all the more so if the have anything to do with it.
