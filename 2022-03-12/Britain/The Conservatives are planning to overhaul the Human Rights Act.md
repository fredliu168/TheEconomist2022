RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS make good villains. They are rich, powerful and foreign, and their money is sometimes ill-gotten and pretty much always in-your-face. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, MPs called for speedy sanctions against those of them who were close to Vladimir Putin. When this took longer than in other European countries, the Conservative government resorted to blaming another favourite bogey man: human-rights legislation.
Crafty lawyers delaying sanctions provided the perfect ammunition for a government that was already set on overhauling Britain’s human-rights regime. The government has proposed scrapping the Human Rights Act (HRA) and replacing it with a Bill of Rights. Britain would remain a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, which the act incorporates into British law. But judges would be encouraged to settle cases without referring to the convention, in the hope that this would make it easier to deport people, say, or stop forced marriages. For a glimpse of how this will work out, compare it to Britain’s most recent attempt to alter its relationship with another pan-European institution: the European Union (EU).

Just as Conservative MPs spent decades campaigning to leave the EU, so too have they spent years moaning about the HRA. Binning it has been Tory policy since 2006. In both cases, tabloids inflamed sentiment. Stories of Brussels bureaucrats interfering in trivia such as the curvature of bananas were common. So too, when the HRA came into force in 2000, were tales of foreign criminals wriggling out of deportation. Outright fabrications were rare. Most of the stories contained a kernel of truth, making them harder to dismiss. Human rights do allow people who have done bad things to avoid deportation if it would ruin their children’s lives. And obviously the world’s biggest single market has rules on the sale of the world’s second-most popular fruit.
In both cases, advantages were and are ignored. There was little credit to be gained in Tory circles by saying nice things about the EU. The HRA, for its part, had the misfortune to come into force as a Labour government was going through an enthusiastically illiberal phase, pledging to detain terrorist suspects without charge for months. It quickly gained the reputation of being a terrorists’ charter. If the timing had been different, so too might have been its image. It was thanks to the HRA that the families of 96 football fans who died in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 finally secured a proper inquest more than two decades later. It concluded that deaths earlier ruled accidental had in fact been unlawful.
Instead the HRA, like the EU, became a whipping boy. Government sources were quick to blame “human-rights law” for sluggishness in imposing sanctions on oligarchs; they did not explain how governments in the EU had moved more swiftly, despite being covered by the same convention. A lack of preparation for long-expected measures was a more likely culprit. Ministers used to hide behind EU law in a similar fashion. Inconvenient demands, such as to remove sales tax from heating bills, would be refused by citing EU law. Now such excuses are gone.
Critics of the HRA do have a point. So much nonsense is written about human-rights law that genuine concerns are dismissed. At the time of the HRA’s introduction, newspapers—from tabloids to broadsheets—worried it would create a privacy law, for the entirely selfish reason that it would make snooping into people’s lives harder. They were right. A thousand years of common law had not produced such a right in Britain; only after the introduction of the HRA did one evolve in successive court cases. Depending on your viewpoint, it is either a long-overdue correction of a disgraceful omission, or a lamentable invasion by an alien principle. Either way, it is a huge shift.
In both cases, however, fear of change to the status quo is overblown. Brexit was sometimes, absurdly, portrayed as the collapse of the Western alliance. Likewise, the convention is painted as a bulwark standing between “Weimar Britain” and the rise of tyranny. This rings hollow, since both Turkey, a borderline autocracy, and Russia, whose government murders its citizens and invades its neighbours, have signed. As Jonathan Sumption, a former supreme-court judge, has argued, the convention is most influential where it is least required, and ignored where it is most needed.
The proper question, in both cases, is whether change is worthwhile, or simply too much trouble for too little potential gain. Britain may have left the EU in 2020. But the Conservatives have barely used their hard-won regulatory freedom. The situation with human-rights reform is similar, as politicians struggle to say what Britain would do under a different human-rights regime that it cannot do now. In briefings, political advisers describe proposals reminiscent of the plots of a comic-book villain to deal with people crossing the Channel in small boats, from holding them in centres in Albania to deploying wave machines. Not just illegality impedes such plans; impracticality and immorality do, too.
Human rights, wronged
As with Brexit, plans to overhaul the HRA are a displacement activity. Why bother reducing a 60,000-strong backlog of court cases waiting to come to trial, or renovating Britain’s crowded and unhealthy jails, when a minister can wave a new Bill of Rights? In the same way, Brexit was a distraction from Britain’s real troubles, which include slow growth and gaping inequality between London and the regions—and were not caused by the EU.
If the government continues down this road, everyone will be unhappy. Human-rights campaigners and lawyers will be aggrieved that a functioning system has been ripped up without good reason. Meanwhile those who reject the very idea of such a convention will be dissatisfied by anything short of abolition. The final similarity between replacing the HRA and leaving the EU will be a result that disappoints both supporters and opponents. ■
