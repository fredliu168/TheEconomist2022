NATIONALIST BLOGGERS in China have a new fascination: global payment systems. Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine, followed by Western sanctions on Russia, have prompted internet pundits to extol the virtues of the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), the rails on which Chinese banks transfer and clear yuan-denominated payments around the world. Some have also taken to bashing SWIFT, the Belgium-based financial messaging system that has started excluding Russian banks from international payments.
CIPS and SWIFT are far from being household names in China. But the sweeping sanctions against Russia—on the use of SWIFT by some of its banks and on its central bank—have shone a spotlight on China’s homegrown financial networks, and the extent to which it can use them to help Russia. Three primary Chinese financial channels are in place to assist—two legitimate, one not. None is a remotely adequate substitute for the links to the Western financial system that Russia has lost.

First, consider the direct connections between the two countries’ central banks, which do not require SWIFT messaging to make transactions. Russia has about $90bn-worth of mainly yuan-denominated deposits held with the Chinese central bank. It also has a 150bn-yuan swap-line agreement with China. It can use these funds to finance imports from China in the event that other trade-finance routes in dollars are blocked, note analysts at Natixis, an investment bank.
But this trade will largely remain in yuan, limiting what Russia can purchase. China’s regulators are still keen to avoid American “secondary” sanctions. Primary sanctions target Russian institutions and American firms that deal with them. The secondary sort have yet to be used, but would target third parties outside America that interact with Russian firms, even if those transactions are permitted by local law. Allowing Russia to sell yuan-denominated assets in order to raise dollars could attract scrutiny and go beyond what Chinese officials are willing to do for their friends in Moscow.

Next, there are the several complex and widespread financial networks China has spent decades building. Take, for example, the web of state-owned banks that have cropped up in commercial hubs around the world. China’s banking regulator may have stated on March 2nd that the country would not join Western sanctions, but most of its big banks will adhere to them, particularly those that interact most with the Western financial system and have legal entities that are domiciled in America. These large institutions, which conduct the bulk of trade finance between the two countries, are unlikely to risk getting blocked from dollar clearing in order to continue doing dollar-denominated business with Russia. Maintaining full access to global financial markets is “more valuable than anything Russia can offer”, according to Neil Shearing of Capital Economics, a consultancy.
UnionPay, China’s state-owned bank-card firm, is another powerful financial network. It is set to gain market share in Russia in the wake of the departures of Visa and Mastercard, which were announced on March 5th. Several Russian banks have announced that they will move to UnionPay, which already has a significant presence in the country.
This shift will not come easily, however. Within Russia, UnionPay’s network is small; many banks have no existing relationship with the company. For Russians abroad the problem is that, despite being in more than 180 countries, UnionPay is a fringe service in America and Europe, according to Jason Ekberg of Oliver Wyman, a consultancy.
CIPS, meanwhile, will not be the miracle solution Chinese bloggers hoped for. In order to protect its capital account, China allows foreign banks to link to CIPS only indirectly, through Chinese clearing banks and using SWIFT messaging, notes Edwin Lai of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. That means Western sanctions may still apply to any transfers between SWIFT-barred Russian banks and foreign banks.
A final route for financial assistance will come through backchannel banks that dodge sanctions. China has a long history of turning a blind eye to smaller banks that finance trade with countries targeted by America and the UN. These activities usually occur on a small scale. And many are caught in the act and hit with sanctions themselves. In 2012 Bank of Kunlun was targeted by America for doing business with an Iranian bank. Some small Chinese banks may take the risk with Russia, but they will be unable to provide the large-scale assistance it needs.
All told, Sino-Russian financial links appear weaker than Russia might hope. The situation is likely to raise questions about the shortcomings in China’s efforts to build global financial networks. For CIPS, many of the problems are clear. In order to maintain control over capital flows, China has not linked the system directly with banks outside mainland China, with the exception of Standard Chartered, a British bank with long-established links to China. CIPS’s indigenous messaging system works only with Chinese banks. To improve it, China must continue opening it up and granting more direct links with foreign banks. The lack of such links is reflected in the system’s transaction volumes. It processes just 13,000 per day, around one-twentieth of the number handled by America’s domestic-payments system, known as CHIPS.
China’s President Xi Jinping has referred to Mr Putin as a “best friend”. The Russian conflict is laying bare some of China’s financial vulnerabilities. That may make the relationship less amicable. ■
