IN HIS EARLY 30s and at the height of his powers, Glenn Gould announced in 1964 that he was retiring from public performance. Classical-music enthusiasts were stunned. Less than a decade before, the maverick pianist had delighted fans with his authoritative recording of J.S. Bach’s “Goldberg Variations”. Now, he declared, “the concert is dead”. In 1965 he accepted a job with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and rode the Muskeg Express as far as it would go, from Winnipeg to Churchill, Manitoba.
On the train, Gould struck up a conversation with Wally Maclean, a retired surveyor who combined a homespun folksiness with the soul of a philosopher. Over breakfast Maclean taught Gould how to read the signs of the icy land, to find “in the most minute measurement a suggestion of the infinite”. The cordial chat turned into a days-long, probing conversation.

Gould adapted this material into “The Idea of North”, a radio documentary exploring Canada’s ambivalent relationship with its northern frontier, which the CBC aired in 1967. It was the first of three experimental audio documentaries he produced about choosing to live apart: “The Latecomers”, about Newfoundland, was broadcast in 1969 and “The Quiet in the Land”, which chronicles a Mennonite community, was released in 1977. Gould would later call the shows his “Solitude Trilogy”.
The theme of isolation resonates again in the wake of the pandemic. What is more surprising is how fresh and experimental the programmes themselves sound, even in the high-tech, peak-podcast era. (They are available to stream via Spotify, Amazon and the CBC’s own website.) Take “The Idea of North”, in which Gould arranged the voices of four main characters into a single fugue. A technician recalled being handed a diagram by Gould, outlining which clips should be heard when; he was “orchestrating the voices” on the page.
Gould thought that, in broadcasting, fidelity to a single human voice was “nonsense”, maintaining that “the average person can take in and respond to far more information than we allot him on most occasions.” He championed a layered form—thinking of it in musical terms, as “contrapuntal”—and experimented with it further in “The Latecomers” and “The Quiet in the Land”. By the late 1960s the CBC had switched from monaural to stereo sound, and editors were able to weave voices into a delicate sonic tapestry.
The formal daring did not just make use of technical advances: it created a sublime listening experience. At the end of “The Idea of North”, Gould sets Maclean’s musings to the final movement of the Fifth Symphony by Jean Sibelius, a Finnish composer who also withdrew from public life. Reflecting on “The Moral Equivalent of War”, an essay by William James, Maclean suggests that, in its arduous extremity, going north is, for Canadians, the modern equivalent of conflict.
The trilogy is a masterwork of sonic innovation. It redefined the radio documentary and influenced generations of audio storytellers. Listen to it on a train—or in any moment of blissful solitude. ■
