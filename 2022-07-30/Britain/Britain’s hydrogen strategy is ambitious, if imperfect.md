One of the most complex problems that Britain faces is climate change. The simplest element in the periodic table is increasingly seen as part of the answer. Low-carbon hydrogen can be made either from natural gas, with the carbon that results captured and stored underground (“blue hydrogen”), or from water, using an electrolyser powered by renewable energy (“green hydrogen”). Hydrogen can help decarbonise activities that cannot easily be electrified. These include industrial processes that require high temperatures, like steelmaking; and forms of transport, including shipping, that have greater ranges than electric vehicles can manage. 
Last year Britain became the 12th country to release a hydrogen strategy. It called for 5gw of low-carbon hydrogen-production capacity by 2030—enough for around 2% of current energy demand. In April the government doubled that goal. Britain, it thinks, can build a “thriving hydrogen economy”, both domestically and by exporting new technology. 
To do so, plenty of cash is on offer. A £240m ($290m) Net Zero Hydrogen Fund will help production projects get off the ground; a “hydrogen business model” will offer price support to low-carbon hydrogen producers. Much of the money will go to two planned clusters: HyNet, in the north-west of England, and the East Coast Cluster, around the Humber and Teesside. 
These regions not only have a big industrial base, including steelmaking, but already make use of lots of hydrogen: it is a component in chemical reactions for refining and the production of fertiliser and methanol. Almost all this hydrogen is currently the dirty “grey” sort, which is made from natural gas but does nothing about the carbon dioxide thereby emitted. Producers of cleaner forms of hydrogen in these areas will be close to potential customers and can use existing infrastructure.
The government’s proposed price-support mechanism is also savvy. This is a variant of the “contracts for difference” approach it has used to support offshore wind and guarantees low-carbon producers a certain price by topping up the market price of hydrogen. In theory, such an approach will allow low-carbon hydrogen to compete with the grey version. As cleaner hydrogen becomes cheaper, support will be withdrawn.
Where things get more heated is over which form of low-carbon hydrogen to back, and how it should be used. The flagship projects at both HyNet and the East Coast Cluster are blue-hydrogen plants. That has sparked criticism from green-hydrogen champions. The blue sort can never be fully emissions-free, they say. It relies on natural gas, which is volatile in price and insecure in supply—about half of Britain’s gas is imported. The government ought to start with the tech it wants to end up with, lest it “end up with stranded assets”, says Graham Cooley of itm Power, a Sheffield-based electrolyser manufacturer.
Blue-hydrogen advocates retort that production will be kept clean by the government’s low-carbon hydrogen standard, which sets a cap on the emissions that hydrogen-makers can generate to be eligible for subsidies. “Above all, blue-hydrogen supporters rightly say that theirs is the only technology that can rapidly produce clean hydrogen at scale: there is simply not enough renewable electricity available to make enough of the green variety. To meet the government’s targets for green hydrogen alone would require about 126twh of renewable electricity. In 2020 Britain produced just 135twh of renewable electricity in total. That argues for a pragmatic approach to setting hydrogen targets; Britain’s plan for half of its production capacity in 2030 to be green may need tweaking. 
Demand is crucial, too. The government has suggested that low-carbon hydrogen could be blended into the gas network, filling consumers’ pipes with a 20/80 hydrogen/gas mix. Because of its low volumetric energy density—one cubic metre of hydrogen contains about a third as much energy as the equivalent volume of natural gas—blending would lead to only a 7% reduction in emissions, even if only green hydrogen is used. But by creating a pathway to scaling up, it could stimulate more production more quickly.
Other ideas for scaling demand are less sensible. The government wants to explore using pure hydrogen for heat, an idea that Michael Liebrich, an energy analyst, calls “stupid”. Safe use of pure hydrogen would mean replacing valves, pipes and appliances in every home, and would still be less efficient than using an electric heat-pump. The government is also pushing hydrogen buses and vans, another application which Mr Liebrich thinks is better suited to electrification. 
Better to encourage the use of hydrogen as an energy-storage medium to help overcome the peaks and troughs of an all-renewables grid. When renewable energy is plentiful, electrolysers can be turned on, producing hydrogen which is then stored. When it is scarce, that hydrogen can be burned in a power station or used in fuel cells to generate electricity. Britain’s plan can be improved, then. But the greater problem would be if it did not exist at all.■
