The clinical trials for Paxlovid, an antiviral drug that fights covid-19 and is produced by Pfizer, were halted in November once it was shown to reduce deaths by 89% among high-risk patients. Joe Biden, America’s president, began taking the drug after he tested positive for covid last week.\nIs Paxlovid living up to its promise? Nationwide data from America, where 2.4m courses have been prescribed, do not show a clear effect. After doses of the drug ramped up in May, the case-fatality rate (cfr) has been flat and the case-hospitalisation rate (chr) has increased.\nOther factors might have offset Paxlovid’s benefits. Testing has fallen, which removes mild cases from the data and raises the cfr and chr. And the ba.5 sub-variant may be more virulent than other strains.\n\n\n\nHowever, even a detailed analysis does not reveal many lives saved by Paxlovid. We built a model to estimate the share of people in a given county who die from covid each week, based on that county’s case count and vaccination rate. We then measured how much the actual rates differed from these expectations, and compared those gaps with the statewide average.\nIf Paxlovid were saving lots of lives, the counties in each state that prescribed the most doses per person should have the greatest outperformance of expected death rates. Those with the fewest courses should have the worst underperformance. In fact, we found there was no difference.\nIs Paxlovid overhyped? Changes in sars-cov-2’s spike protein do not affect the method by which the drug blocks its replication. Pfizer’s lab studies suggest it is effective against the Omicron variant.\n\n\n\nInstead, the drug may not be reaching those who need it most. The counties prescribing Paxlovid the most tend to have high vaccination rates and few comorbidities, such as diabetes. On average, people in these areas are unusually likely to survive covid even without Paxlovid’s help.\nPaxlovid is rare in counties that have low vaccination rates, and where many are poor and unhealthy. People with covid in these areas may be less likely to seek out and obtain the drug when it is effective, during the first five days of illness.\nIf Paxlovid becomes as widespread as vaccines, it will save more lives. The news of Mr Biden’s swift recovery might help. ■\nAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub.\nSources: Centres for Disease Control and Prevention; Global Health
