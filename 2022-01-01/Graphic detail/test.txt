for reflection on the past. But many minds will also inevitably cast forward. If the fitful past two years of the covid-19 pandemic offer any lesson, it is that the future remains murky and uncertain.\nNot to be deterred, we have turned to prediction markets to give us a glimpse of 2022. Pooling data from punters on exchanges like Betfair, Metaculus, PredictIt and Smarkets, can offer a theoretically better guide to the future than plunging headlong into the unknown. Will the pandemic claim millions more? Might Russia invade Ukraine? Could America’s high inflation persist? And will Tom Brady win an obscene eighth Super Bowl? Another eventful year awaits. ■\n\nSources: Betfair; Metaculus; PredictIt; Smarkets\nPicture credit: Disney/Getty Images","description":"The wisdom of crowds trumps a crystal ball","articleDescription":"The wisdom of crowds trumps a crystal ball","imageUrl":"https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20220101_GDP111.jpg","imageHeight":720,"imageWidth":1280,"datePublished":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-12-30T14:17:00Z","dateCreated":"2021-12-28T20:03:13Z","isPrintArticle":true,"printEdition":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","copyrightYear":2022,"dateline":"","inLanguage":"en","interactive":true,"scripts":["https://infographics.economist.com1"],"css":[]}},[],{"shouldDropPaywall":false},{"section1":{"id":"/content/md2otnsr4fvud5kbahk8m3ktoif2fs2i","type":["Blog"],"headline":"The Economist explains","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","hasPart":{"parts":[{"headline":"How well do lateral-flow tests for covid-19 work?","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/12/29/how-well-do-lateral-flow-tests-for-covid-19-work","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20210410_BLP503.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media"}},{"headline":"Our most read climate explainers of 2021","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/12/19/our-most-read-climate-explainers-of-2021","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20211218_BLP522.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media"}},{"headline":"Our most read explainers about the world of crypto","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/12/19/our-most-read-explainers-about-the-world-of-crypto","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20211218_BLP523.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media"}}],"__typename":"HasPart"}},"section2":{"id":"/content/omi23dr8h15h8c33t2gkb2cju8ap758o","type":["Blog"],"headline":"Podcasts","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","hasPart":{"parts":[{"headline":"The Economist Asks: best of 2021","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2021/12/30/the-economist-asks-best-of-2021","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20211225_PDP502.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media"}},{"headline":"“There’s no life that’s more interesting than another”—our obituaries editor on 2021’s notable deaths","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2021/12/30/theres-no-life-thats-more-interesting-than-another-our-obituaries-editor-on-2021s-notable-deaths","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20220101_PDP503.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media"}},{"headline":"“Has the country gotten more democratic?
