The company blamed “ongoing supply chain challenges” and factory shutdowns, but said that it had produced more cars in June than in any previous month. 
The Bank of England warned that the  for Britain and the global economy has “deteriorated materially”. It noted, however, that liquidity and capital positions at British banks remain strong, and that they still have “considerable capacity” to support lending to households and businesses.

Most countries battling surging prices might take comfort that things aren’t as bad as in , where inflation has reached 78.6%.

Justice desserts
 sued Unilever, its parent company, to block the sale of its business in Israel to a local licensee. The ice-cream maker has refused to trade its tubs of Chunky Monkey and Caramel Chew Chew in East Jerusalem and the West Bank (in effect a boycott of Israel) in support of the Palestinians. In its suit, Ben &amp; Jerry’s said allowing the sale affected its autonomy and its values of “advancing human rights” and economic and social justice. Many Israelis contend that its boycott is Half Baked.
