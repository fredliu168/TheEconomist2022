Supporting the ECJ’s ruling
Your article on the European Court of Justice’s judgment on public registers of beneficial ownership, a decision you suggest will make it harder to track dirty money, missed a number of crucial points (“”, December 3rd). The registers encompass all firms in the European Union, thus catching millions of ordinary businesses (for example, a hairdressing salon or bakery) as well as companies with sensitive activities (a business that supplies goods to Ukraine, say, or medical equipment to abortion clinics in America). And before the judgment you had a situation where the registries obliged every compliant family business with no links to crime or tax evasion to disclose its shareholding structure to anyone in the world, opening up possible rifts within the family. 
The registries affect only companies established in the EU member states, where the risk of money laundering through companies is relatively low. Though transparency is important, the EU judgment is an invitation (and an admonishment) to have a balanced debate in this area. Compliant families have a legitimate interest in keeping their personal data away from prying eyes. This is all the more important at a time when Europe is being swept by populism and the European Convention on Human Rights is under attack.

Getting people off the streets
I was pleased to read about the improving situation in homelessness in Washington, albeit from shocking levels (“”, November 26th). It is true that government is the most important stakeholder responding to this issue, but it is reductive to present government as the sole entity that is required to end homelessness, certainly affordably or quickly. 
Solving homelessness requires government, companies, landlords, startups and communities coming together and playing to their strengths. As with any complex problem, solving homelessness also requires innovative data-driven technology, which startups can build faster and more cheaply than government. Rapid progress to consign homelessness to history requires a true alliance of the corporate world, the technology industry and local charities, among others.

Handing out the pink slips
As someone who has overseen job cuts and observed the impacts of good and bad redundancies, I recommend Bartleby’s column on the right way to do lay-offs () to all senior executives. I would add that laid-off employees should not be treated as criminals. Systems and critical documents need to be safeguarded, but that does not justify immediately escorting someone off the premises as if they had been terminated for cause. 
It is better to allow the employee a transition period to let them hand off work responsibilities and say goodbye to colleagues. The effort to treat the laid-off employee as one would like to be treated sends a strong message of respect to the “survivors” (for that is what they surely are). The brutal redundancy processes depicted in “Up in the Air”, a film from 2009, are a model of what should be avoided, not embraced.
Dean Pavlakis

Start the redundancy process by sticking to the universal corporate mantra that “our people are our greatest asset”, and recognise that it is not a reduction in total headcount that is needed, but in payroll. Dismissing staff when there are so many alternatives, such as job shares, sabbaticals and part-time working, which many employees would happily take, is not only destructive for those workers made redundant, but for the company. Downturns are never for ever. One day you’ll be looking to hire them back.

A pensioner writes
I am tired of reading insulting references to “coddled pensioners” that suggest we live the high life on state benefits (“”, November 12th). My full state pension this month, after contributing for 40 years, is £608.44 ($742). Does anyone at  live on such a sum? Furthermore, I did not receive my pension until I was 65, coming into that age group when the retirement timing for women changed. That was a hardship for a lot of women who had either been married and divorced, or not worked in their early lives due to child-care constraints.
I am fortunate enough to have an adequate workplace pension, which means that I would be regarded as a prosperous pensioner. I am quite happy to pay tax on my income, as I did over all of my 42-year working life, but we are only a minority of the over 65s in Britain. A substantial number of us are still working into their 70s. And for those unlucky enough to need full-time care in their last years, dementia, Parkinson’s disease and the other ailments of old age are the only circumstances where individuals are required to sell their homes to pay for their care. This is so that we substantially reduce the “burden” on family and the state. 
I suggest that you examine your own prejudices in this matter, as the zeitgeist allows things to be said and written about older people which would not be said about other groups. Try the thought experiment of replacing coddled “pensioners” with the words blacks, gays, women, or transwomen and transmen.

What’s on in Northfield 
Your piece on America’s tight labour market was suitably focused on the small city of Northfield (“”, November 26th). I have a granddaughter at Carleton College and have developed a fondness for Northfield. You depicted very well the character and economy of the place, with one omission. The high point of Northfield’s year is the celebration of the Defeat of Jesse James Days each September. The occasion commemorates the valiant conduct of local people in thwarting the attempted robbery of the First National Bank by the outlaw Jesse James, the Younger gang and others in 1876. The annual event is a grand piece of Americana with a parade, carnival, fried food and re-enactment of the episode. Fortunately there were sufficient workers to carry it off again this year.

Is Glasto ready for Bagehot?
I know  would have many illegal drugs legalised or at least decriminalised, and for good reason. However, Bagehot’s debauched night in search of “the new masculinity” () was sobering reading. Should we not treat binge drinking and other forms of alcohol misuse as we would other drugs, as abuse? If not, I look forward to the report of a future Bagehot weekend: LSD-induced ego-death at Glastonbury preceded by a good chundering of vegan burrito.
