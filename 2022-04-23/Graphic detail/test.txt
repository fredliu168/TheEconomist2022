Economist"],"url":"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/23/nearly-half-of-mariupol-has-suffered-grave-damage","type":"Article","articleBody":"After failing to conquer   Ukraine’s capital, Russia has sent the bulk of its forces to the country’s   east. If its army assaults the full Donbas region in the way it has attacked   Mariupol, Ukraine’s most-bombarded city, there may not be much left to   “liberate” once the fighting ends. \n   Russia has reduced Mariupol’s defenders to a small garrison in a steelworks.   The death toll is unknown, because journalists and aid workers cannot enter   the city safely. In contrast, destroyed buildings are visible from space. And   satellite data suggest that since the war began, 45% of the city’s built-up   area has been gravely damaged. \n\n  \n\n   To produce this estimate, we used freely available data from the   synthetic-aperture radar (sar) aboard Sentinel-1, a European   satellite duo. sar bounces microwaves off the Earth’s surface   and measures the energy “echo” when they return. It works 24 hours a day, and   is not thwarted by clouds. \n   The strength of the echo depends on the roughness of the reflecting surface.   Rubble creates stronger signals than smooth roofs do. It also alters where the   returning wave is in its cycle when it reaches the satellite. \n   Because of variation in measurement and atmospheric conditions,   sar yields slightly different results each time a satellite   flies over a given location, even if there are no changes on the ground. To   minimise the impact of these small fluctuations, we used three snapshots for   each area: two taken before an attack, and one afterwards. In damaged regions,   the third image should differ much more from the first two than the first two   do from each other. \n   To test this method’s accuracy, we used a map of part of Mariupol compiled by   experts at the un Satellite Centre, who pored over satellite   photos taken on March 14th and logged locations where they could visually   identify destruction. Based on sar data from mid-March, our   model flagged as damaged 92% of the areas marked by the un, and   classified as unscathed 85% of places where the un did not find   damage. \n\n   Applying this model to all of Mariupol using data from April 17th yields a   grim tally. Since early March the share of the city’s footprint that has been   severely damaged has risen by an average of 0.8 percentage points per day. It   is now 45%, representing some 20,000 buildings throughout the city. Measured   by area, industrial sites, such as the steelworks where Ukraine’s last   soldiers are holed up, have been the hardest hit. But in terms of sheer   numbers, more than 90% of damaged buildings were residential. It is likely   that at least a third of Mariupol’s pre-war inhabitants no longer have homes   to which they can return. ■","description":"Satellite images show that 90% of ruined buildings were
