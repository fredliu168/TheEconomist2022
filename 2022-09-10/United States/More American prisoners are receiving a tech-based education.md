Pedro, a gang leader at a prison in Massachusetts, is a physically imposing man, with several teardrop tattoos. Yet for most of his life he did not know how to read or write. More than 70% of inmates in America have the literacy skills of a fourth-grade (nine-year-old) pupil, or below. Joining a prison’s basic adult-education classes can ruin a gang leader’s reputation. But Pedro’s prison was piloting a programme that gives tablets to inmates and lets them study privately. One day, the warden recalls, Pedro whispered to her: “I can read!”
Education in prison is widely known to reduce recidivism. In America over 75% of prisoners are re-arrested within five years of release. A big reason is their inability to find work. This pattern is costly. A report from rand, a think-tank, found that $1 invested in prison education yielded $4-5 in taxpayer savings from reduced incarceration costs in the three years after release. 
Another study by rand suggests participation in some form of education reduces the rate of re-arrest by over 40%. Post-secondary education has the greatest impact, data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics show. Prisoners who get an associate’s degree (ie, one granted by a technical or community college) have a recidivism rate of 14%. A bachelor’s degree lowers it to 5.6%.
Most inmates have long been barred from using internet-enabled devices, on security grounds. But the covid-19 pandemic, which led to extended jail lockdowns that kept prisoners stuck in their cells, forced a rethink. A “technology revolution” is coming to prison education, says Shannon Swain, a superintendent at California’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation that is rolling out laptop-based education at prisons across the state.
California is among at least 25 states to have deployed tablets in prisons since 2016. In many states inmates can use them to obtain the equivalent of a secondary-school diploma, to study for professional-licensing tests or, for a few, to take college courses. In a few states prisoners may also use them to watch films, listen to music and contact pre-approved family members. Most of those incarcerated will one day re-enter society, at which point digital-literacy skills will matter even more.
A college education remains out of reach for most, notes Brian Hill, the chief executive of Edovo, a provider of educational tablets for prisons. He says that tablets give inmates “more opportunity on a daily basis” to make choices about their future, by allowing them to work on lessons that match their ability and interest. Mr Hill was approached by an inmate at a prison in Arkansas who told him that tablet-based learning had allowed him to read bedtime stories to his grandchild.
Teaching at maximum-security facilities such as California State Prison, Los Angeles County has been “an exercise in flexibility”, in the words of one professor. Before the pandemic the prison had a dozen desktop computers without internet access; teachers brought lessons in on usb drives. School closures due to covid meant lessons went back to being done by mail. Class materials could take over a month to reach inmates. So in late 2021 the prison introduced laptops with internet access. These are restricted to an ultra-secure version of Canvas, a learning management system, meaning that inmates have access only to previously vetted sites and articles.
In Maine’s prisons, inmates enrolled in educational programmes get their own laptops with internet access. Some websites are blocked, such as social-media platforms, and network access is monitored. But the state is experimenting with having fewer restrictions. Those studying for a degree may have email addresses (prison staff must be copied on exchanges) and log into Zoom classes from their laptops.
More open access to information can be a hard sell in places built to prioritise security. Prison staff worry that it could facilitate new forms of crime. Advocacy groups for victims argue that prisoners may use the internet to harass them. Tough-on-crime politicians are reluctant to spend money on improving prisoners’ lives. Yet for now the benefits of remote, tech-enabled learning have perhaps nowhere been clearer than among the incarcerated. ■
