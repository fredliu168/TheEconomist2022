# Russia’s crony capitalism disincentivises economic reform, says Konstantin Sonin 
##### But without change Vladimir Putin will lose the war in Ukraine, reckons the Russian economist

THE EMERGING stalemate in the Russia-Ukraine war poses huge challenges for Russia even as it offers opportunities to Ukraine. It gives the latter country time to revitalise its army, which could eventually force Russia out of its territories. That is because although Vladimir Putin is powerful politically, Russia’s economic system is impervious to reform. This means that even though the Russian economy will survive sanctions in the short term, it will not be able to sustain a national war effort and simultaneously maintain Russians’ quality of life over the long term.
When discussing the major dilemmas that Mr Putin faces, commentators often focus on political constraints. Yet there are few, if any, signs of an impending internal coup or a major popular uprising. The sheer size of the police and security forces in Russia, and the state’s total control of the legal system, make even small-scale protests very dangerous. Many of Mr Putin’s close subordinates are reportedly unhappy about the war, personal sanctions against them and the country’s growing economic isolation, yet they have neither the experience nor the will to act.
Rather, the coming challenge for Mr Putin is that the war needs, and Western sanctions require, the economy to operate differently. Sanctions have squeezed Russian manufacturers. The Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies reported that the value of Russian imports in June was 40% lower in machinery and mechanical appliances, 60% lower in electrical equipment and 65% lower in motor vehicles than on average in the three-month period between December 2021 and February 2022. Domestic production in these same industries has fallen dramatically too. The recent sharp drop in the use of modern ballistic and cruise missiles by Russian forces shows how limited its current production capacity is, even when stretched to the limits. Russian airlines have reportedly started to cannibalise their fleets for spare parts as sanctions block their access to necessary equipment and maintenance. 
Some pain from sanctions is yet to be felt. High prices for oil and gas mean that a fall in Russian production has been compensated for by a rise in prices. But I do not expect this to last (others disagree). Europe is weaning itself off Russian exports (EU gas imports from Russia were down by 65% year-on-year in the last week of June according to the European Central Bank.) And even if the drop in Russian GDP is not as dramatic as some experts were expecting six months ago, forecasts remain pessimistic. According to the IMF, Russia’s GDP is expected to contract by 6% this year. Next year it could shrink by 3.5%. Especially for a self-inflicted economic crisis, these are pretty horrible numbers. 
One economy-wide solution would be to rely on “parallel imports”—when goods acquired without the original manufacturer’s consent via intermediaries—as well as on trade with China and other non-Western countries. In March the government changed regulations to allow retailers to import products without the brand owner’s permission (unless the owner continues to operate in Russia). In June the change became law. 
Smuggling won’t be enough to get Russia through, however. It will need people and firms willing to invest in it. But new investors face unwelcoming terrain in the country. The past two decades have seen the rise of powerful domestic lobbies in many industries. Skilled in fighting imports and capital from the West, they will be just as adept at fighting imports from new sources. Over the years, Mr Putin’s governments have passed rules and built institutions, including a general ban on food exports from America and the EU, that restrict or even prohibit international trade and foreign participation in the Russian market. Ministers, bureaucrats and top managers of state enterprises directly benefited from rents due to restricted competition. Mr Putin should not use the same people to reform the system as they are its main beneficiaries. But he does not have any other choice.
Another, related, challenge for Mr Putin is that his regime is excessively expensive to run. For years he encouraged the blurring of the lines between the state and big business: many of his bureaucrats, including those in the armed forces, became rich by simultaneously running a government department and a private business. Denis Manturov, the newly appointed tsar of the defence industry, is the richest member of the cabinet. Reliable reports put his worth at hundreds of millions of roubles, although his career has been almost entirely spent as an executive in state-owned defence enterprises. Yet this is exactly where people become multi-millionaires in Mr Putin’s Russia. Ramping up military production by creating lavish opportunities was inefficient even when the economy was flush with money. Now it ought to be outright impossible.
Mandarins and managers of state-owned enterprises expect to be very highly compensated for their efforts. The government has yet to announce the list of construction companies that will get contracts to restore the occupied Ukrainian cities demolished by the invading army. Yet there is little doubt that the contracts will go to favoured cronies. As the experience of the Chechen wars demonstrated, state-financed reconstruction after warfare is a lucrative business for a favoured few. 
In the long run, Mr Putin’s main problems might be the anti-war politicisation of Russia’s youth and growing unhappiness of the population with falling incomes. Yet a revolution might be years, if not decades, in the making. Right now his main problem is that the system he has created is resistant to the reform the economy needs in order to switch to a war footing. Russia cannot afford to keep splurging on payments to oligarchs’ businesses. But those businesses have never operated without such largesse before. This means that a ceasefire, in spite of Russian control over a large part of Ukraine, will be in Ukraine’s favour.
