 By Ian McEwan. 
In recent years Ian McEwan’s fiction has been playful and inventive. “Nutshell” (published in 2016) was an audacious restyling of “Hamlet” that featured as its narrator a garrulous, erudite unborn child. “Machines Like Me” (2019) explored the brave new world of artificial intelligence within a counterfactual past. And the novella “The Cockroach” (2019), written as a response to Brexit, repurposed Kafka’s “The Metamorphosis” to satirise the state of a divided nation.
Mr McEwan’s latest novel returns to more traditional fictional territory. This is not to say that “Lessons” is devoid of big ideas and artistic risks. Indeed, in some respects it may be the author’s most ambitious work to date. Well over 400 pages long, and tracking the course of a single life, it is a dense yet deeply absorbing book.
One day in 1986 Roland Baines has an “insomniac memory” of a formative experience at boarding school: during a piano lesson, his teacher, Miriam, kissed him on the lips. Back in the present, Roland’s waking thoughts continue to be dominated by the reckless act of another woman—his wife, Alissa—and the needs of his infant son. A week earlier Alissa vanished, leaving him holding the baby, fielding a detective’s questions and harbouring “the untidy unwashed feeling of being a suspect”.
From here, the novel charts Roland’s progress through the years. Some sections are devoted to his past, in particular his sentimental education from Miriam and his subsequent failure at school. Unlike his absent wife, who achieves international renown as a novelist, much of Roland’s adult life consists of missed opportunities and squandered potential. Instead of making a career as a poet or a concert pianist, he ekes out a living writing “wised-up doggerel” for greetings cards and playing the piano in lounge bars.
Nevertheless, he finds comfort and stimulation in books, music, family, friends and a late-flowering love affair. At one point he believes he has grasped the way to steer his life smoothly: “Make a choice, act! That’s the lesson.” Fate, though, may not be finished with him yet.
Mr McEwan’s account of his protagonist’s long, “shapeless existence” could have made for a rambling, directionless novel. In places it feels episodic, reading like a catalogue of births, deaths, marriages, relationships and reunions (or “reckonings”). Yet Roland emerges as a vivid and sympathetic creation. He feels all the more real when Mr McEwan shows how his life is affected by global upheavals, from the Cuban missile crisis to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the spread of covid-19.
“How easy it was to drift through an unchosen life, in a succession of reactions to events,” writes Mr McEwan. Roland’s journey is not easy, but the dramatic evocation of his struggles and setbacks means readers will follow him every step of the way. ■
