Why? | Culture | The Economist","shareSnippet":"Johnson – Some words have two opposite meanings. Why?","headline":"Some words have two opposite meanings. Why?","section":"Culture","keywords":[],"author":["The Economist"],"url":"https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/08/some-words-have-two-opposite-meanings-why","type":"Article","articleBody":"Fans of ancient history may have thrilled to the news in the New York Times that a mystery was solved: “A Long-Lost Branch of the Nile Helped in Building Egypt’s Pyramids.” A new study, the subheading said, “confirms a long-held theory that builders used the river to transport the heavy blocks that comprise the ancient wonders.” But usage grumps may have scowled. Indeed, the line was soon changed: in the revised version, the wise old theory was “that builders used the river to transport the heavy blocks that make up the ancient wonders.”\nThe traditional rule is that “the whole comprises the parts, and the parts compose the whole”. The pyramid comprises the blocks, not the other way round; by the same reasoning, “comprised of ” is wrong too. But if you do not know this rule, you are hardly alone. It was a favourite of Theodore Bernstein, a longtime copy guru at the Times, who repeated it in usage books of 1958, 1965 and 1977. After all that, it does not seem to have stuck with the paper’s editors, nor with many other competent writers.\nA word should not, in a perfect world, mean the opposite of itself; if galaxies comprise stars, surely stars cannot comprise galaxies. But in fact there are lots of words that are their own opposites, so many that they have not just one but several names: contronyms, auto-antonyms or, most poetically, “Janus words”, named for the two-faced Roman god who looks in opposite directions (and so gave his name to January, which faces back into the old year and forward to the new).\n“Sanction”, for example, can mean both “to approve of” and “to lay a penalty upon”. “Fast” can mean speedy or stuck in place. “Cleave” can mean to split, or to cling tightly. “Fulsome” praise can be full-throated and genuine, or cloyingly insincere. One class of Janus words is particularly troublesome: those that mean different things on opposite sides of the Atlantic. “Moot”, for instance, means “that which can be argued; debatable” in Britain; it means “not worthy of discussion” in America.\nSome of these oddities arise from mere coincidence. The two senses of “cleave” are actually different words that happen to be written the same way in modern English. (That is why the “cutting” version has the past participle “cleft”, while the other does not.) \nBut others are the result of drift. Look up almost any common word in a historical tome such as the Oxford English Dictionary, and the oldest meaning will often be surprisingly far from the current one. (“Silly”, for example, is a distant cousin of “soul”, and once meant something like “holy”.) The Janus words arise when a new meaning branches off, while the old one survives. So the oldest version of “fast” means “fixed in place”, but at its branching moment, it came to be an adverb meaning to do something with a kind of intensity. It is probably from that “intensity” sense that the “moving intensely”—that is, quickly—came about. \nThat process of gradual change (while the old meaning endured) is also what happened to “fulsome” and “moot”. The oldest meaning of “fulsome” was merely “abundant, plentiful”, but this connotation underwent a process that linguists call “pejoration”: the literal meaning stays roughly the same, but the sense of “in a bad way” is added. By 1602 Ben Jonson was using “fulsome” in the sense of cloying or overdone. And in the 19th century Americans began using “moot” to mean not just debatable, but debatable only theoretically, and so of no point.\nFinally, some Janus words come about through simple confusion. “Inflammable” has been used to mean both “able to be set on fire” and “unable to be set on fire”. That first meaning is the older one, sharing a root with “inflame”. But in- is also a common negating prefix, leading to the second interpretation. And so it is with “comprise”, which may have arisen in its more recent sense (the parts comprising the whole) through confusion with its cousin, “compose”. \nIt is tempting to think that such self-contained opposites cannot and should not survive. But the deprecated “the whole is comprised of the parts” usage has been around since the 16th century. One Wikipedia editor has removed it from articles tens of thousands of times. That, though, was because others (themselves, presumably, knowledgeable volunteer editors) had written it tens of thousands of times in the first place. Whether all this is really a tolerable state of affairs may be moot in the British sense of the word. But “comprised of”, at least, seems to be here to stay, making it moot in the American one.\nRead more from Johnson, our columnist on language:\nThe struggle to preserve regional languages (Aug 25th)\nShould “data” be singular or plural?
