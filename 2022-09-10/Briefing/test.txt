Unlike in America, where the army’s professionalism is beyond question, in Brazil a putsch is not unthinkable. The country is awash with coup chatter. In private, some senior politicians do not rule out the possibility. In August police raided the homes of several Bolsonarista businessmen who had allegedly been discussing the merits of a putsch on WhatsApp. The businessmen say they were just grumbling and the police had no business raiding their homes. Brazil last had a coup in 1964, and Mr Bolsonaro often praises the old military regime. He scrupulously protects the military’s perks, and has included 6,000 officers in his government. \nYet still, a coup is unlikely, says Vinicius de Carvalho of King’s College London. The armed forces have evolved since 1964. They still meddle more in politics than they should, and have aired doubts about the security of the voting system, but “they know that if Bolsonaro loses there will be another government and they will have to work with it,” he says. The Biden administration has made clear that a putsch would make Brazil a pariah.\nA more likely scenario is that Mr Bolsonaro could cry electoral fraud and stir up street protests. He paid rapt attention to the storming of America’s Capitol in 2021. His son Eduardo, a close adviser, celebrated it. A similar insurrection in Brazil could be “much worse”, says Cláudio Couto, a political scientist. Brazil is a more violent country than America, Mr Bolsonaro’s supporters are heavily armed, and it is unclear whether the military police–386,000 gunslingers whose job is to keep order–are more loyal to the constitution or the president. “They never made the transition to democracy, and they are very keen on Bolsonaro,” frets Mr Couto.   \nIf an insurrection erupts, the electoral tribunal could be the mob’s first target. Its chief, Alexandre de Moraes, who is also a Supreme Court judge, is hated by Bolsonaristas. Last year he ordered the jailing of a congressman who appeared to advocate violence against judges. Mr Bolsonaro immediately pardoned the lawmaker. \nAnother possibility is that Mr Bolsonaro might cite public disorder as an excuse to invoke extra emergency powers and postpone Lula’s inauguration. The campaign is already violent. In July an official of Lula’s Workers’ Party (pt) was shot dead at his birthday party by a policeman shouting that Lula was a crook and all pt supporters should die. In the first half of this year, 45 Brazilian politicians were murdered. Political threats, assaults, kidnappings and homicides have risen 335% in the past three years, according to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaristas have also pelted Lula rallies with human waste, on one occasion from a drone. \nThe main reason why Brazil’s election matters to the rest of the world is because one candidate wants to save the Amazon and the other does not. When Lula was president, he cracked down on illegal logging, mining and cattle-ranching.  Mr Bolsonaro has slow-walked enforcement and let the chainsaws whirr. The pace of deforestation has risen by about 70%, and Brazil’s federal environmental agency has failed to take action after 98% of deforestation alerts. If there were a prize for accelerating climate change, Mr Bolsonaro would be a contender. \nTo a typical Brazilian voter, however, the Amazon is distant (Amazonian states are 60% of Brazil’s land mass but home to only 13% of the population). The campaign is being fought over livelihoods and identities. Mr Bolsonaro’s record in these areas is, respectively, mixed and divisive. \n\nThe economy took a beating during the pandemic, but is recovering. Growth is expected to be 2.3% in 2022 and 0.5% in 2023. Mr Bolsonaro’s market-friendly finance minister, Paulo Guedes, persuaded him to slow the alarming growth of public pensions and formalise the independence of the central bank, both useful reforms. Unemployment has fallen from 12.2% to 9.1% on his watch. Tarcísio de Freitas, a former minister, says that “economic liberty and less red tape” are making Brazil more prosperous. In the run-up to the election, the president is lavishing extra handouts on the poor, which is helping him catch up in the polls (see chart). \nPlenty of well-off Brazilians still back Mr Bolsonaro for fear that Lula will raise taxes or make it harder to fire workers. But others think the economy would be doing better if the president’s toxic global image did not scare off investors. Many executives signed a letter in July warning that Brazil’s democracy was in “grave danger”. \nLike other populists, Mr Bolsonaro has forged a direct personal connection with a large group of voters. His supporters call him “Mito” (literally “myth”, but more akin to “legend”). He rarely gives press briefings, preferring to communicate with fans on right-wing podcasts, YouTube and Facebook Live. The 44% of Brazilians who get their political news from television back Lula by 52% to 25%; the 25% whose main source is social media prefer Mr Bolsonaro by 47% to 37%. His online fans are more engaged than Lula’s, according to Quaest, a pollster. And he has built for them a paranoid world untethered from reality. \nLula, he suggests, will imitate Latin America’s worst far-left despots. A recent tweet from his account warns that Lula’s “ally” in Nicaragua persecutes Christians, the one in Venezuela closes newspapers and the one in Cuba arrests dissidents. There is no real evidence that Lula plans to do any of these things. But imaginary evidence abounds. Luiz Antonio Ayres, a prosecutor in Rio, cites a popular trope. After Lula was released from prison in 2019, he said he was “mais maduro” (more mature). This is “a clear reference to Venezuela”, a failing state run by a tyrant called “Maduro”, says Mr Ayres. “There is a power plot. [Lula is coming back] to impose a socialist dictatorship on Brazil.”  \nThe president’s most ardent support comes from three overlapping groups: people in Brazil’s agricultural heartland who dislike being bossed around by urban snobs; social conservatives who fear an erosion of traditional values; and Brazilians who are scared of crime and want guns to defend themselves. Mr Bolsonaro panders deftly to all three. \nFor Brazilians in the hinterland, he has built roads, subsidised fuel and given extra handouts to truck drivers. This year alone, he has awarded more than 340,000 title deeds to irregularly occupied farmland. He has made it easier for farmers, who sometimes clash with indigenous folk and landless activists, to arm themselves. He backs ranchers and miners who chop down trees. He has suggested that environmentalists who complain about the destruction of the Amazon are part of a foreign plot to steal it. “The Amazon is Brazil’s, not yours,” he told foreign critics in 2019. \nFarmers did well under Lula, too, thanks to Chinese demand for beef and soyabeans. But Mr Bolsonaro speaks the language of the frontier more fluently. Donning a cowboy hat at a recent rodeo, he rode a horse and thanked the audience for farming: “Without you, the world starves.” He brags about offering more credit to farmers than any president in history, and slashing environmental fines by 80%.  \nHe has brought God into government, forgiving church debts and siding with believers in Congress. His message is amplified in evangelical churches, which for nearly a third of Brazilians are a source of guidance and friendship. Mr Bolsonaro leads Lula by 16 percentage points among evangelicals. Many see him as a defender of family values, and forgive his crudeness. (This week he led fans in a chant implying that he never fails to get it up.)\nMany religious conservatives see the graft that thrived under the Workers’ Party as un-Christian. Lula “should be in prison”, says Ricardo Gomes, a devout hotel worker in Rio. Raimundo Costa, who sells internet services in a slum outside Manaus in the Amazon, says when Lula was president, officials built smaller-than-planned subsidised homes and pocketed the difference. He plans to vote for Mr Bolsonaro.   \nGun lovers support the president because he has made it much easier for them to pack heat legally, especially if they register as hunters, sharpshooters or collectors. A hunter may own 30 guns; a collector, an unlimited arsenal. Under Mr Bolsonaro, the number of guns in private hands has doubled to nearly 2m, according to Instituto Sou da Paz, a think-tank. \nMany Brazilians want guns because they are scared of violent crime, against which Mr Bolsonaro touts a shoot-first approach. He has proposed legal shields for cops who kill criminals and hoped that the latter would “die…like cockroaches”. Brazil’s murder rate has plunged since he took office, from 28 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 22 in 2021. The reason is that “more good people have guns” to deter the bad guys, says Debora Carvalho, an instructor at the Gunner Shooting Club in Barra da Tijuca, a posh suburb of Rio. \nCriminologists cite other factors. A big gang war broke out in 2017 but later subsided. Reforms that predated Mr Bolsonaro’s presidency, such as beefing up detective teams and separating gang bosses from other inmates in prisons, may have started to bear fruit after he took office. Still, better public safety helps Mr Bolsonaro, even if Brazil’s murder rate is three times higher than America’s. \nBrazil in black and white\nWhether voters back him depends partly on whether they are more terrified of criminals or the police and, as in the United States, views on this topic have a racial tinge. In Alemão, a hillside favela in Rio, your correspondent saw young gangsters sitting by the street openly cradling submachine guns that some armies would envy. Yet residents complain more about the cops. In July a police raid ended in 18 deaths. Camila Santos, a resident, tells her son never to run when police are near, because “as a black boy he could be taken for a trafficker and killed.” Her son is six.\n\nTalking anonymously, two military policemen standing outside Alemão offer a different perspective. Cops are tied up with red tape, they grumble. Before launching a raid, they must ask permission from the state prosecutor’s office. Both say they back Mr Bolsonaro because he backs them, whereas Lula makes excuses for criminals. \nPlenty of voters in fancier neighbourhoods agree. For some, the fear that slum-dwellers will come and rob them outweighs any squeamishness about police brutality. A white woman sunbathing on a beach in Barra da Tijuca complains that she doesn’t feel safe and can’t wear jewellery in public. Lula wants to give human rights to criminals, she gripes, but “I don’t think someone who rapes and steals is human.” \nMr Bolsonaro urges his supporters to carry guns not just to defend themselves against criminals, but also against shadowy forces that might seek to oppress them. “Everybody has to buy a rifle, damn it! Armed people will never be enslaved,” he told a crowd last year. He wants his supporters to be frightened that someone might take away both their guns and their freedom. Ms Carvalho shudders that Lula has promised, if elected, to close shooting clubs and turn them into libraries.  \n“It’s like we live in two different Brazils,” says Mr Casarões. In Bolsonaro-world, ordinary folk are threatened by a godless, gun-banning elite that wants to put boys in dresses and run the country like a socialist narco-state. Only Mr Bolsonaro (whose middle name means “Messiah”) can save them.  \n\nLula’s supporters include some cranks and extremists, too. At a recent rally in São Paulo some wore t-shirts accusing Mr Bolsonaro of genocide (for his negligent response to covid-19), and amiable ladies insisted that Lula’s corruption conviction was a frame-up by the cia.  \nBut there are two big differences between the leaders. Lula, for all his flaws, does not live in a fantasy world, and he does not incite violence. In May Mr Bolsonaro said it was a good thing if many of his opponents bunched together, because then “one little grenade kills everyone”.  He often mimes shooting people.  \nIf Mr Bolsonaro loses the election but persuades his supporters they were robbed, he could remain Brazil’s most influential opposition politician, leading a mass movement of the aggrieved, fired up by a shared sense of victimhood. In America today, nearly any Republican who seeks high office must pretend to believe that an election was stolen. This myth could one day propel Mr Trump back into the White House. It could work for “Mito”, too. \nMr Bolsonaro’s followers in Brazil’s Congress, in the states and on the streets could make it harder for a President Lula to govern. If Lula were to fail, thanks to Bolsonarista obstruction, perhaps combined with another commodity crash or scandal, the man whose middle name is “Messiah” might return. “How do democracies die?” asks Oliver Stuenkel, author of “The Post-Western World”. “When the would-be autocrat is re-elected.”■","about":{"public":null,"__typename":"Taxonomies"},"print":{"headline":"Trump’s tropical

Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s rainforest-ravaging president, is likely to lose an election in October. His leftist rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is 13 points ahead. But many of Mr Bolsonaro’s supporters do not believe the polls.  \nMost polling firms are “in the hands of the left”, says Eduardo Oliveira, a former military man, at an independence-day rally for Mr Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro on September 7th. “If you do a poll on the streets, you’ll see that 80-90% support Bolsonaro.” Mr Oliveira fears that the voting machines are rigged in Lula’s favour, and this scares him. For Lula plans to end private property, get rid of churches and turn Brazil into a “communist dictatorship”, he believes. If Lula is declared the winner, there will be an uprising, warns Mr Oliveira.  “Liberty is settled with bullets...If necessary, we’ll go to war.” \nDonald Trump once called Mr Bolsonaro his “number-one ally”. “Star pupil” would be more apt. Mr Bolsonaro is doing to Brazil something uncannily similar to what Mr Trump has done to the United States, using many of the same methods. He has poisoned its politics with an intravenous drip of demagoguery, aggravating divisions. His opponents are wicked, not merely misguided. “We face a struggle between good and evil,” he said this week. His supporters are the only true patriots. Criticism of his actions is “fake news”. He constantly stokes fear, warning his followers that their way of life is under attack. \nToday, he appears to be preparing his supporters to swallow a Big Lie. He signals that the election in October could be rigged. Brazil’s digital voting system is well-designed and secure, but stories of skullduggery have spread like Amazonian fires on social media. Only 25% of Bolsonaro supporters say they trust the electoral system “a lot”, compared with 60% of Lula supporters. A hefty 31% of Bolsonaristas do not trust it “at all”, a share that will surely rise if their man loses and cries foul.\nMany Brazilians worry that he will do exactly this, borrowing yet another page from Mr Trump’s playbook. If he insists that he won and urges his supporters into the streets, Brazil could see a haphazard insurrection like the assault on Congress by a Trumpist mob on January 6th, 2021, or worse. Whatever happens, neither Mr Bolsonaro nor his movement is likely to go away. They threaten democracy; and Brazil’s safeguards are weaker than America’s. It only shrugged off military rule in 1985.\nMr Bolsonaro says he will accept the election result if it is “clean and transparent”. But he keeps suggesting it will be neither. In July he summoned startled foreign ambassadors to complain about his own country’s voting system. “He’s 100% not going to accept the result if he loses,” says Guilherme Casarões, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. \nWith a slick disinformation campaign, Mr Bolsonaro has convinced his core followers that Brazil will go to hell if his opponent takes over: that Lula plans to shut down churches, forge alliances with drug gangs and set Brazil on a path to Venezuelan-style dictatorial socialism. Lula did none of these things when he was president between 2003 and 2010.\nTwo flavours of nostalgia\nThat said, Lula is no paragon. His party was mired in corruption last time it was in power. He himself was convicted of accepting bribes (in the form of a flat and renovations of a country house) and spent a year and a half in prison. His convictions were annulled on a technicality and he maintains his innocence. \nLula’s pitch to voters is that life was better when he was in charge. Though radical in his youth, he governed as a fiscally prudent social democrat who poured many of the fruits of a commodities boom into helping the hard-up. Income per head rose 47% on his watch, though it fell back somewhat when the boom turned to bust under his successor, Dilma Rousseff. \nMr Bolsonaro’s record is worse on several counts. Some 815,000 people died in the pandemic, which he never took seriously. Inflation is high (though falling), and 33m of 215m Brazilians struggle for food. (“The whole world can’t have filet mignon,” said the president in August.) \n\nMany people will vote for Lula because the alternative scares them. “Yes, the corruption allegations against Lula bother me. But he’s the only hope to stop Bolsonaro,” says Maria Julia Lima, an art student in São Paulo. As the election’s first round on October 2nd nears, many Brazilians worry that Mr Bolsonaro is planning something Trumpian, in the sense of treasonous.\nThe worst outcome would be a coup. Unlike in America, where the army’s professionalism is beyond question, in Brazil a putsch is not unthinkable. The country is awash with coup chatter. In private, some senior politicians do not rule out the possibility. In August police raided the homes of several Bolsonarista businessmen who had allegedly been discussing the merits of a putsch on WhatsApp. The businessmen say they were just grumbling and the police had no business raiding their homes. Brazil last had a coup in 1964, and Mr Bolsonaro often praises the old military regime. He scrupulously protects the military’s perks, and has included 6,000 officers in his government. \nYet still, a coup is unlikely, says Vinicius de Carvalho of King’s College London. The armed forces have evolved since 1964. They still meddle more in politics than they should, and have aired doubts about the security of the voting system, but “they know that if Bolsonaro loses there will be another government and they will have to work with it,” he says. The Biden administration has made clear that a putsch would make Brazil a pariah.\nA more likely scenario is that Mr Bolsonaro could cry electoral fraud and stir up street protests. He paid rapt attention to the storming of America’s Capitol in 2021. His son Eduardo, a close adviser, celebrated it. A similar insurrection in Brazil could be “much worse”, says Cláudio Couto, a political scientist. Brazil is a more violent country than America, Mr Bolsonaro’s supporters are heavily armed, and it is unclear whether the military police–386,000 gunslingers whose job is to keep order–are more loyal to the constitution or the president. “They never made the transition to democracy, and they are very keen on Bolsonaro,” frets Mr Couto.   \nIf an insurrection erupts, the electoral tribunal could be the mob’s first target. Its chief, Alexandre de Moraes, who is also a Supreme Court judge, is hated by Bolsonaristas. Last year he ordered the jailing of a congressman who appeared to advocate violence against judges. Mr Bolsonaro immediately pardoned the lawmaker. \nAnother possibility is that Mr Bolsonaro might cite public disorder as an excuse to invoke extra emergency powers and postpone Lula’s inauguration. The campaign is already violent. In July an official of Lula’s Workers’ Party (pt) was shot dead at his birthday party by a policeman shouting that Lula was a crook and all pt supporters should die. In the first half of this year, 45 Brazilian politicians were murdered. Political threats, assaults, kidnappings and homicides have risen 335% in the past three years, according to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaristas have also pelted Lula rallies with human waste, on one occasion from a drone. \nThe main reason why Brazil’s election matters to the rest of the world is because one candidate wants to save the Amazon and the other does not. When Lula was president, he cracked down on illegal logging, mining and cattle-ranching.  Mr Bolsonaro has slow-walked enforcement and let the chainsaws whirr. The pace of deforestation has risen by about 70%, and Brazil’s federal environmental agency has failed to take action after 98% of deforestation alerts. If there were a prize for accelerating climate change, Mr Bolsonaro would be a contender. \nTo a typical Brazilian voter, however, the Amazon is distant (Amazonian states are 60% of Brazil’s land mass but home to only 13% of the population). The campaign is being fought over livelihoods and identities. Mr Bolsonaro’s record in these areas is, respectively, mixed and divisive. \n\nThe economy took a beating during the pandemic, but is recovering. Growth is expected to be 2.3% in 2022 and 0.5% in 2023. Mr Bolsonaro’s market-friendly finance minister, Paulo Guedes, persuaded him to slow the alarming growth of public pensions and formalise the independence of the central bank, both useful reforms. Unemployment has fallen from 12.2% to 9.1% on his watch. Tarcísio de Freitas, a former minister, says that “economic liberty and less red tape” are making Brazil more prosperous. In the run-up to the election, the president is lavishing extra handouts on the poor, which is helping him catch up in the polls (see chart). \nPlenty of well-off Brazilians still back Mr Bolsonaro for fear that Lula will raise taxes or make it harder to fire workers. But others think the economy would be doing better if the president’s toxic global image did not scare off investors. Many executives signed a letter in July warning that Brazil’s democracy was in “grave danger”. \nLike other populists, Mr Bolsonaro has forged a direct personal connection with a large group of voters. His supporters call him “Mito” (literally “myth”, but more akin to “legend”). He rarely gives press briefings, preferring to communicate with fans on right-wing podcasts, YouTube and Facebook Live. The 44% of Brazilians who get their political news from television back Lula by 52% to 25%; the 25% whose main source is social media prefer Mr Bolsonaro by 47% to 37%. His online fans are more engaged than Lula’s, according to Quaest, a pollster. And he has built for them a paranoid world untethered from reality. \nLula, he suggests, will imitate Latin America’s worst far-left despots. A recent tweet from his account warns that Lula’s “ally” in Nicaragua persecutes Christians, the one in Venezuela closes newspapers and the one in Cuba arrests dissidents. There is no real evidence that Lula plans to do any of these things. But imaginary evidence abounds. Luiz Antonio Ayres, a prosecutor in Rio, cites a popular trope. After Lula was released from prison in 2019, he said he was “mais maduro” (more mature). This is “a clear reference to Venezuela”, a failing state run by a tyrant called “Maduro”, says Mr Ayres. “There is a power plot. [Lula is coming back] to impose a socialist dictatorship on Brazil.”  \nThe president’s most ardent support comes from three overlapping groups: people in Brazil’s agricultural heartland who dislike being bossed around by urban snobs; social conservatives who fear an erosion of traditional values; and Brazilians who are scared of crime and want guns to defend themselves. Mr Bolsonaro panders deftly to all three. \nFor Brazilians in the hinterland, he has built roads, subsidised fuel and given extra handouts to truck drivers. This year alone, he has awarded more than 340,000 title deeds to irregularly occupied farmland. He has made it easier for farmers, who sometimes clash with indigenous folk and landless activists, to arm themselves. He backs ranchers and miners who chop down trees. He has suggested that environmentalists who complain about the destruction of the Amazon are part of a foreign plot to steal it. “The Amazon is Brazil’s, not yours,” he told foreign critics in 2019. \nFarmers did well under Lula, too, thanks to Chinese demand for beef and soyabeans. But Mr Bolsonaro speaks the language of the frontier more fluently. Donning a cowboy hat at a recent rodeo, he rode a horse and thanked the audience for farming: “Without you, the world starves.” He brags about offering more credit to farmers than any president in history, and slashing environmental fines by 80%.  \nHe has brought God into government, forgiving church debts and siding with believers in Congress. His message is amplified in evangelical churches, which for nearly a third of Brazilians are a source of guidance and friendship. Mr Bolsonaro leads Lula by 16 percentage points among evangelicals. Many see him as a defender of family values, and forgive his crudeness. (This week he led fans in a chant implying that he never fails to get it up.)\nMany religious conservatives see the graft that thrived under the Workers’ Party as un-Christian. Lula “should be in prison”, says Ricardo Gomes, a devout hotel worker in Rio. Raimundo Costa, who sells internet services in a slum outside Manaus in the Amazon, says when Lula was president, officials built smaller-than-planned subsidised homes and pocketed the difference. He plans to vote for Mr Bolsonaro.   \nGun lovers support the president because he has made it much easier for them to pack heat legally, especially if they register as hunters, sharpshooters or collectors. A hunter may own 30 guns; a collector, an unlimited arsenal. Under Mr Bolsonaro, the number of guns in private hands has doubled to nearly 2m, according to Instituto Sou da Paz, a think-tank. \nMany Brazilians want guns because they are scared of violent crime, against which Mr Bolsonaro touts a shoot-first approach. He has proposed legal shields for cops who kill criminals and hoped that the latter would “die…like cockroaches”. Brazil’s murder rate has plunged since he took office, from 28 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 22 in 2021. The reason is that “more good people have guns” to deter the bad guys, says Debora Carvalho, an instructor at the Gunner Shooting Club in Barra da Tijuca, a posh suburb of Rio. \nCriminologists cite other factors. A big gang war broke out in 2017 but later subsided. Reforms that predated Mr Bolsonaro’s presidency, such as beefing up detective teams and separating gang bosses from other inmates in prisons, may have started to bear fruit after he took office. Still, better public safety helps Mr Bolsonaro, even if Brazil’s murder rate is three times higher than America’s. \nBrazil in black and white\nWhether voters back him depends partly on whether they are more terrified of criminals or the police and, as in the United States, views on this topic have a racial tinge. In Alemão, a hillside favela in Rio, your correspondent saw young gangsters sitting by the street openly cradling submachine guns that some armies would envy. Yet residents complain more about the cops. In July a police raid ended in 18 deaths. Camila Santos, a resident, tells her son never to run when police are near, because “as a black boy he could be taken for a trafficker and killed.” Her son is six.\n\nTalking anonymously, two military policemen standing outside Alemão offer a different perspective. Cops are tied up with red tape, they grumble. Before launching a raid, they must ask permission from the state prosecutor’s office. Both say they back Mr Bolsonaro because he backs them, whereas Lula makes excuses for criminals. \nPlenty of voters in fancier neighbourhoods agree. For some, the fear that slum-dwellers will come and rob them outweighs any squeamishness about police brutality. A white woman sunbathing on a beach in Barra da Tijuca complains that she doesn’t feel safe and can’t wear jewellery in public. Lula wants to give human rights to criminals, she gripes, but “I don’t think someone who rapes and steals is human.” \nMr Bolsonaro urges his supporters to carry guns not just to defend themselves against criminals, but also against shadowy forces that might seek to oppress them. “Everybody has to buy a rifle, damn it! Armed people will never be enslaved,” he told a crowd last year. He wants his supporters to be frightened that someone might take away both their guns and their freedom. Ms Carvalho shudders that Lula has promised, if elected, to close shooting clubs and turn them into libraries.  \n“It’s like we live in two different Brazils,” says Mr Casarões. In Bolsonaro-world, ordinary folk are threatened by a godless, gun-banning elite that wants to put boys in dresses and run the country like a socialist narco-state. Only Mr Bolsonaro (whose middle name means “Messiah”) can save them.  \n\nLula’s supporters include some cranks and extremists, too. At a recent rally in São Paulo some wore t-shirts accusing Mr Bolsonaro of genocide (for his negligent response to covid-19), and amiable ladies insisted that Lula’s corruption conviction was a frame-up by the cia.  \nBut there are two big differences between the leaders. Lula, for all his flaws, does not live in a fantasy world, and he does not incite violence. In May Mr Bolsonaro said it was a good thing if many of his opponents bunched together, because then “one little grenade kills everyone”.  He often mimes shooting people.  \nIf Mr Bolsonaro loses the election but persuades his supporters they were robbed, he could remain Brazil’s most influential opposition politician, leading a mass movement of the aggrieved, fired up by a shared sense of victimhood. In America today, nearly any Republican who seeks high office must pretend to believe that an election was stolen. This myth could one day propel Mr Trump back into the White House. It could work for “Mito”, too. \nMr Bolsonaro’s followers in Brazil’s Congress, in the states and on the streets could make it harder for a President Lula to govern. If Lula were to fail, thanks to Bolsonarista obstruction, perhaps combined with another commodity crash or scandal, the man whose middle name is “Messiah” might return. “How do democracies die?” asks Oliver Stuenkel, author of “The Post-Western World”. “When the would-be autocrat is re-elected.”■","description":"He will not go quietly","articleDescription":"He will not go
