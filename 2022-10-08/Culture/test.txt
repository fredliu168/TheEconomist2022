And very often those countries have seen themselves linguistically: France is the home of those who speak French, and so on. This has always been a simplification. But one state, one nation and one language remains a Platonic ideal.\nWhich makes it all the odder that, at the heart of Europe, one nation in one state is one of the most happily, successfully multilingual places on Earth. Switzerland, which has a population comparable in size to Hungary’s or Austria’s, has four official languages, and a huge amount of local variety beyond that.\nAbout 60% of Swiss speak German as their mother tongue; but if you studied the language of Goethe in Hamburg or Hanover, good luck understanding a conversation among Swiss. The local “Schwyzerdütsch” is so far from the standard that children who speak it have to learn High German in school. But the Swiss are proud of their German, which can even be starkly different from valley to valley. A German executive in Geneva says that when visiting Zurich, he often finds it more practical to speak English.\nJust over 20% of Swiss speak French, the next-biggest language. Then there is Italian, spoken by only about 8% of the population, and, most remarkably, Romansh, a Romance language that is the native tongue of only around 0.5% of Swiss. Yet all three, alongside German, are official languages in the country. The Italian spoken is often a local variety, and even tiny Romansh has widely diverging dialects. One Romansh-speaker says that, when he was in the army, it was easier for him to use German with Romansh-speaking comrades than what was notionally their common language.\nHow can a country so linguistically diverse work, and indeed be one of the richest in the world? François Grin of the University of Geneva says that it is because of a national myth, whereby “Switzerland functions not despite but because of its multilingualism.” The point of the myth, he says, is not that it is true (or false), but that it is useful. The Swiss work hard at keeping it going.\nTraditionally, Swiss students studied the next-biggest national language after their own as their first foreign one. Italian-speakers often learn both German and French (and Romansh-speakers, the lot). And English is taught in all schools, as well as being heard frequently in the streets of the most international cities, Geneva and Zurich. Switzerland is also generous to the many who speak yet another language; Geneva makes its schools available for the teaching of Portuguese after hours to the large Portuguese-descended population, for example. The children of immigrants typically master the local dominant language, even Swiss-German, which is not formally taught. \nBut this doesn’t make every Swiss a polyglot paragon. The key to Switzerland’s functioning is its principle of territoriality: in most of the 26 cantons, one language rules. (Three cantons are bilingual in German and French, and Graubünden is trilingual in Italian, Romansh and German.) This territoriality can be coercive—Swiss courts have found that cantons may forbid students to be primarily educated in another national language even in private schools. The principle’s strength means that some Swiss who have not lived outside their home region may never fully master another national language. \nAnd in recent decades, many of the German-speaking cantons, following Zurich, have shaken the Swiss model by introducing English before French as the first foreign language learned in schools. Since even the Swiss do not easily manage three or four languages (remembering that Swiss German and High German are quite distinct), this means that many in German-speaking Switzerland do not master French if they focus on English.\nBut even if every individual Swiss is not a walking interpreter’s booth, the country remains deeply committed to its multilingual model. It is not an easy one to copy: Switzerland is the product of fiercely independent cantons joining the confederation for mutual benefit while still considering themselves sovereign. The country must respect localism, or it would not exist.\nThat said, most European states are amalgamations of what were once smaller units too. Often their founding stories are that they were destined to be united, including by language. They could learn from Switzerland, whose national story holds that unity and uniformity are not the same thing.■\nRead more from Johnson, our columnist on language:\nTranslating royal names is a relic of European history (Sep 22nd)\nThe struggle to preserve regional languages (Aug 25th)\nShould “data” be singular or plural?
