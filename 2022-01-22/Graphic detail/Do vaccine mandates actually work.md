###### A shot in the arm
# Do vaccine mandates actually work? 
##### The Canadian and European experiences suggest they do

ONE IN FIVE American adults have not yet got a covid-19 vaccine. This recalcitrant fifth remains despite behavioural nudges, vaccine lotteries and schemes that pay people to get jabbed. On January 13th the Supreme Court blocked a harder-nosed approach—a vaccine-or-test mandate on over 80m workers—from going into effect. How much might it have helped? The recent, successful experience of America’s northern neighbour sheds some light.
On August 5th 2021, Quebec became the first Canadian province to announce a vaccine requirement to enter bars, gyms and restaurants. In the following months other Canadian provinces followed suit. That variation created a natural experiment: comparing provinces with these requirements to those without provided a way to estimate how effective they actually are.



Four economists—Alexander Karaivanov, Dongwoo Kim, Shih En Lu and Hitoshi Shigeoka, all of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia—ran the calculations. In the week after the announcement of pass-sanitaire requirements, first-dose vaccinations increased by 42% over the previous week; and by 71% over two weeks. They estimated that 287,000 more people were vaccinated within six weeks as a result.
In the summer of 2021 France, Germany and Italy all introduced similar, nationwide vaccine mandates for non-essential activities. The authors calculated that these were effective, too. By the end of October 2021, more than 85% of Italy’s eligible population had been jabbed, an estimated 12 percentage points more than if the rule had not gone into effect. In France the policy was credited with an eight percentage-point increase; in Germany with five.
Another working paper, by Miquel Oliu-Barton and his colleagues, corroborates these findings. They found that requiring evidence of vaccination in France, Germany and Italy not only increased jab uptake but also prevented 46,000 hospital admissions, €9.5bn ($11.2bn) in economic losses and 6,400 deaths.


Rich countries are now diverging on restrictions. Some are doubling down and proposing more punitive mandates (see Europe section). Quebec now has plans to introduce a “health contribution fee”. In America, left without a federal mandate, the vaccine-refusal problem may grow more entrenched. The converse of striking success is squandered opportunity. ■
