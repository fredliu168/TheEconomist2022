Prayuth Chan-ocha, a 68-year-old former general who declared himself Thailand’s prime minister, continues to be dogged by the messy politics he intended to abolish when he seized power from an elected government in 2014. First Mr Prayuth ruled by diktat. Then, in 2019, he sought a veneer of legitimacy by allowing elections. When a party critical of military rule performed annoyingly better than the authorities expected, it was dissolved and its charismatic leader, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, charged with lèse-majesté.\nIn Thailand the king, Maha Vajiralongkorn, is absolute, and conservatives like Mr Prayuth who rule in his name love the notion of “guided democracy”. No political figure can be allowed to challenge the authority of the monarch or the privileges of an establishment whose members thrive on favours, perks and status derived from their relationship to royal power. Guided democracy is supposedly free of grubby politicking, because it embodies a Buddhist-inflected cosmos founded on morality and merit flowing from an infallible royal. \nSo much for that. In reality the king is an erratic martinet. And the ruling coalition is as prone to infighting as any other political grouping. Last month it suffered a humiliating defeat in an election for the governorship of Bangkok, the teeming capital. It failed to agree on a single candidate, allowing the opposition’s choice, Chadchart Sittipunt, to storm through. The incumbent, supported by the army’s party, Palang Pracharath (ppp), performed abysmally.\nThe bickering has enveloped national-level politics. Mr Prayuth seized power with two generals of his generation, Prawit Wongsuwan, now the deputy prime minister, and Anupong Paochinda, the interior minister. Their relationship is under strain. Ambitious younger officers riding on Mr Prawit’s coat-tails are working hard to undermine Mr Prayuth. His influence in the army is waning now that he no longer commands it. It does not help that the king openly favours his own King’s Guards over the similarly elite Queen’s Guards, through which Mr Prayuth rose to the top.\nAn influential former ppp secretary-general, Thamanat Prompow, a Prawit ally, has deserted the ruling camp and lobs rocks at Mr Prayuth. Other conservatives bemoan sleaze in the ppp, deriding Mr Prawit’s claim that his mound of luxury watches was a gift from a late friend. \nWith the ruling coalition distracted, the opposition is on the up. On June 15th it filed a motion of no confidence in the government, citing economic mismanagement and a raft of other shortcomings. If some conservatives join the opposition, Mr Prayuth could lose the vote in July—a derider of parliamentary politics done down by them. \nThat a government could fall, says Greg Raymond of the Australian National University in Canberra, “would seem to go against our understanding of how a junta uses tools and techniques to maintain its position.” Yet, in effect, not much would change from the perspective of the establishment. Guided democracy, after all, would remain. Any new prime minister would uphold the king’s supremacy. And the armed forces would still, behind the scenes, call the shots. \nEven so, the aspirations of ordinary Thais may yet disrupt the elite’s machinations. Student-led protests in 2020 and 2021 that called for reform of the monarchy were suppressed. Yet resentment among the young towards the self-serving establishment runs high. Many Thais are angry about the government’s handling of the pandemic, which hammered tourism and led to the closure of tens of thousands of small businesses. For all the government’s emphasis on infrastructure, education and the rural economy are neglected.\nEven if Mr Prayuth survives the vote of no confidence, he must still hold a general election in the coming year. The idea, of course, is that it too will be “guided”. An appointed senate is to keep parliament in check in the event of an electoral challenge to the establishment. \nBut a democratic upset is a possibility. Mr Thanathorn and the Pheu Thai movement, backed by a populist former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, whose threatened return from exile was a factor behind Mr Prayuth’s coup, remain popular. The Senate’s willingness to hold the line in the event of an opposition landslide is untested. The army has a habit of launching coups—Mr Prayuth’s was Thailand’s 13th. But democratic politics has a habit of reasserting itself. \nRead more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia:\nWhat is the point of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework?
