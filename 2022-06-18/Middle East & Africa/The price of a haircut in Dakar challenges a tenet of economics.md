Economics often seems oversupplied with theory—all dogmatic assumptions and curves with obscure names. Yet economics students in the rich world can get surprisingly practical advice from wild-haired professors explaining non-tradable goods: “When in poor countries, get a haircut.”
The prices of goods that are traded internationally should not vary nearly as much as prices of things like haircuts that cannot be stored or shipped. This is because a trim depends largely on local costs such as wages, which are much lower in poor countries. 
Your excessively frugal correspondent ignored this and chose to cut his own hair in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. Chaos swiftly ensued. So did a desperate search for a salon to fix the troubled thatch. A friendly Senegalese provided an expert clip—and a bill to make any hairdresser in Manhattan blush. What happened to one of the most cherished dictums in economics? 
This particular stylist had lived briefly in Paris. Perhaps her prices came from the chic sixth . Yet Dakar is bristling with cheap salons. Competition ought to have snipped her hopes of selling costly cuts. Instead her business is bustling, as is a rival salon that merrily charges similar prices. The clientele at both are mainly well-heeled Senegalese, along with a few expats. Might jet-setting customers have their expectations anchored to prices in Paris or London, making haircuts, in effect, seem more tradable than they are?
That seems unlikely. Heady prices may instead be a signal that a barber is as good as a Parisian one. Patronising such an outlet, in turn, may be a way of displaying wealth. At any rate, haircuts are clearly less fungible than professors profess, since their prices differ wildly within the same city. This suggests another of economists’ assumptions rarely applies: that of perfect competition. 
For competition to be perfect, products must be nearly identical. Yet the market for mohawks in Dakar casts doubt on this idea. Some barbers pull in clients by blasting Afrobeats. Others have comfier chairs or screen football matches. Perfect competition also requires clients to have perfect information about the options on offer. Yet many of Senegal’s best snippers do not show up on the internet; most do business by word of mouth. And even omniscient customers might be loth to cross Dakar to get the best deal. The tangled traffic may keep extortionate stylists in business in swanky suburbs, while high rents and red tape may keep competitors out.
This admittedly small study suggests that parsimonious profs ought to update their advice. Students should get their hair cut not just in poor countries but, once there, in poorer parts of town. They might also add that, just as there are no free lunches, cutting one’s own hair may well be a false economy.
