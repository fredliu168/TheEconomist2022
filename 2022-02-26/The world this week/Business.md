The Hang Seng Tech Index of technology companies listed in Hong Kong fell to its lowest level since its creation in 2020.

Airbus signed an agreement with CFM International, a venture between General Electric and Safran, a French aerospace firm, to develop a combustion engine for aircraft fuelled by hydrogen. The company said it was its most significant step yet “to usher in a new era of hydrogen-powered flight”.

 launched a fight with McDonald’s by nominating two directors to its board in a dispute over animal rights. The activist investor is a veteran of boardroom battles, including an unsuccessful attempt to block a buy-out of Dell and a clash with Warren Buffett over an oil-company takeover. His beef with McDonald’s is its treatment of pregnant pigs. Mr Icahn thinks they should not be kept in gestation crates. The fast-food chain says it expects these to be phased out. Until then Mr Icahn could uncomfortably hog the limelight with calls for an abrupt end to the practice.
