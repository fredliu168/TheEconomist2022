# Private markets are less rewarding than they used to be 
##### The future may well be bright. It will certainly be less high-octane

SUPERRETURN, A DAVOS for PE, held its annual bash in Berlin last November. One session on “Winners and Losers” went well, recalls Alex Koriath of Cambridge Associates, though “there weren’t really any losers to talk about.” A self-congratulatory air permeated the event. Nile Rodgers and his band, Chic, entertained buy-out bigwigs with their hit “Good Times”.
Top-of-the-market stuff? Few would call the party’s end. This year is unlikely to be as sweet as 2021, yet it may still be a record year for private markets. Unlike last year, fund sponsors are likely to look to raise more than investors are comfortable with, says Mr Green at Lazard. Some may end up short of their targets, rather than blowing through them again.

Big risks include inflation and interest rates. Inflation is a curate’s egg for PE; firms with pricing power do better than those without. Higher rates can wreak havoc among leveraged buy-outs, but also reflect higher growth. A rise of more than two or three percentage points could trigger defaults and bail-outs. On top of dearer debt, business faces wage pressures, supply-chain problems and more covid-19 uncertainty. And private funds must contend with more competition as public-market funds push into private markets to meet demand for higher yields.
In less benign financial conditions, some pension funds, insurers and family offices that came late to private markets may reassess their tolerance of illiquidity. A tech slump, to which PE is more exposed than it was, would also test investors’ loyalty.

Given how heady price tags are in buy-outs, “no one is banking on selling at higher multiples than today,” says one dealmaker. “It will be all about growing underlying profits enough to make a nice return on the same or a lower multiple.” The giants of PE talk of picking “themes”: energy transition, health-care technology, take your pick. Choose the right one, and the right firms, and you can do well regardless of today’s valuations, they say. Amazon is not the only success story once viewed from the rubble of the dotcom bust as having been wildly overpriced.
David Swensen might disagree. At his last investment-committee meeting at Yale, he was “very bearish” on PE valuations, says someone who was present. The ex-colleague also recalls Swensen admitting “the possibility that everything he had learned was wrong and we were now in a different world where valuations could stay higher for longer.” But it didn’t sound like he believed it.
Swensen thought the best private funds could thrive in periods of economic disruption, riding the cycle by acquiring under valued or distressed assets. But the idea that private markets are greedy when others are fearful, and can profit accordingly, may be wrong. Last year Sirio Aramonte and Fernando Avalos of the BIS studied risk-taking in private markets and concluded that they are as procyclical as public markets. They found capital deployment in both PE and debt to be “positively correlated with stockmarket returns, ie, more transactions are completed in bullish times.”
Whatever the short-term outlook for private markets, they have become a large and permanent feature of global finance. They have expanded and matured during the past decade’s hunt for yield. Products have become more sophisticated. A secondary market has blossomed. All this has made more investors, including retail investors, comfortable with them.
With private markets representing less than a tenth of global investable assets, there is plenty of room for growth. Some parts of the world, particularly Asia, look underserved. China’s crackdown on private enterprise has led some PE firms to cut back there. But the region as a whole, long heavily reliant on bank finance, is a market waiting to be tapped. Private funds are licking their lips at the prospect of more corporate carve-outs from Asian conglomerates, like those seen at Hitachi and Panasonic. Europe, also largely reliant on banks and home to thousands of family-owned firms approaching generational transfer, is fertile ground as well. Barring an interest-rate shock, “we’re not even close to starting the shift towards more [private-markets] activity,” reckons Bruce Flatt, boss of Brookfield Asset Management.
More competition will narrow outperformance over public markets. For the biggest firms, lower returns come partly by design: they are becoming diversified asset managers, geared to steady management-fee income, with greater scale compensating for lower returns. The industry’s metabolism is slowing as it seeks to add longer-term capital that allows assets to be held for longer periods. Such capital already makes up almost a quarter of Blackstone’s assets.
Making this pivot work is the biggest challenge for a new generation of buy-out bosses. Success implies asset-gathering on a much larger scale, as Blackstone and other big firms try to get closer in size and substance to BlackRock, the giant of global asset management. That will alarm those who see PE as capitalism red in tooth and claw. But private markets are emerging as a viable alternative—or stepping stone—to public ownership. The more sophisticated they grow, the greater the choice for firms and investors alike. And that has to be good for capitalism. ■
