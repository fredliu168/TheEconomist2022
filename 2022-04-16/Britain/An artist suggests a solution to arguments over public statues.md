SIMON DE MONTFORT, a key figure in parliamentary history, was anti-Jewish even by 13th-century standardsâ€”in 1231 he expelled all Jews from Leicester. Students at De Montfort University have argued that their institution should be renamed. Now an American artist, Douglas Fishbone, has installed an inflatable statue of de Montfort at Leicester Contemporary art gallery. Mr Fishbone suggests that inflatable sculptures of dicey figures could be set up, taken down and set up again as cultural winds change. It is a joke, but a serious one. Rows over statues are fierce partly because figures of bronze and stone are so tough, threatening to stand for ever unless removed.
