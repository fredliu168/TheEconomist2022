MISSING FROM the official start of campaigning, on February 8th, were the song-and-dance performances that usually signal the launch of Philippine elections. Missing too was any sense of suspense. Polls put Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos so far ahead of other candidates for president that he seems certain to win the vote on May 9th. Opinion surveys in December and January both gave him well over half the total vote. Why waste good money on razzmatazz?
Although few Filipinos really believe that suitability for political office runs in the blood, many certainly vote as if it does. Two of the three most recent presidents, Benigno Aquino and Gloria Arroyo, were the offspring of previous ones. Rodrigo Duterte, the foul-mouthed incumbent, is an exception. The popularity of Mr Marcos, the son of the late president of the same name, is a return to form. He is particularly attractive to younger voters, who seem either unconcerned about or unaware of the record of the older Marcos, a dictator who ruled for over two decades and was deposed only after a popular uprising in 1986. The younger Mr Marcos tries to maintain his appeal by avoiding the subject of his father’s regime all together.

Yet the prospect of another Marcos in Malacañang, as the presidential palace is known, enrages many other voters who seem to believe that unsuitability for political office also runs in the blood. Detectives are investigating one suspected threat to kill Mr Marcos. More lawful efforts to keep him out of the presidential palace are under way, too. Two sets of petitions to stop him contesting have been submitted to the Commission on Elections. They argue that Mr Marcos’s record as a convicted criminal—he was found guilty of failing to submit tax returns when he was a provincial governor—disqualifies him from public office.
A committee of the commission rejected one set of petitions. The petitioners have appealed to the commission as a whole. A separate committee disbanded in disarray before ruling on the other set. That committee is due to be reformed with new members. Whatever rulings are eventually handed down, either the petitioners or Mr Marcos will appeal against them in the Supreme Court.
In the meantime, the commission has started printing ballot forms, with Mr Marcos’s name on them. The Philippines, like America, holds elections for several levels of government on a single day. Various versions of the machine-readable form must serve the purposes of congressional and local elections as well as the presidential election. That makes them so long and complicated that they must be printed months in advance, before the matter of Mr Marcos’s eligibility can be resolved. If he is disqualified before election day, voters may choose to mark their ballots in his favour anyway. And if Mr Marcos wins anything like the number of votes suggested by opinion surveys, as seems plausible, none would count.
The laws are not clear, but in such circumstances the presidency probably would not go to the candidate with the next-highest number of votes. Instead, the newly elected vice-president, who runs independently of the president, is likely to be first in line. Sara Duterte—another presidential progeny—is widely expected to win that election. Mr Marcos has said he would accept her as his substitute. Such an outcome would also be acceptable to Ms Duterte’s father, who at the outset wanted her to run for the highest office. (Mr Duterte, who is limited to a single term by the constitution and has declared himself neutral in the election, appointed all the sitting members of the election commission.)
The constitution and many laws were drafted with the specific intention of preventing the emergence of another regime as widely loathed as the elder Marcos’s. Paradoxically, their workings now seem geared to frustrating popular sentiment by preventing his son from following in his footsteps as a democratically elected president. If the Supreme Court does disqualify him, another of the country’s periodic bouts of instability is in the offing. ■
