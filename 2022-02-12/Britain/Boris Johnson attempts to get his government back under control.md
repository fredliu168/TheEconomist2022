STEVE BARCLAY is making a career out of mopping up stricken governments’ messes. In November 2018 Theresa May appointed him as her third Brexit secretary in just over two years. Now he faces a similarly joyless task for a similarly ailing administration. On February 5th he was appointed Boris Johnson’s fourth chief of staff in a year and a half, charged with bringing order to a disorderly Downing Street.
In recent days Mr Johnson’s most senior officials have left Downing Street in a wave of resignations after revelations of a series of lockdown-busting parties that derailed his government. The departures of Dan Rosenfield, his chief of staff; Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary; and Jack Doyle, his communications director, who oversaw a campaign of denials, seemed inevitable.

More damaging was the exit of Munira Mirza, his head of policy and a close ally for more than a decade. She resigned, ostensibly in protest at Mr Johnson’s accusation that Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s leader, had failed to bring a notorious paedophile to book in his former role as head of the crown prosecution service. Many in Westminster were sceptical about her queasiness: a former revolutionary communist and contributor to Spiked, a magazine for angry contrarians, she had previously defended Mr Johnson’s pugilism.
The job Mr Barclay inherits is a relatively recent innovation in British politics: it was Margaret Thatcher who first appointed a chief of staff. The office-holder is a “human Swiss Army knife”, wrote Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s chief of staff, in his memoirs. He or she is the prime minister’s most trusted adviser on everything from fashion to statecraft. The most stable prime ministers are wedded to theirs: Jonathan Powell served Tony Blair for 12 years in government and opposition; Ed Llewelyn spent ten under David Cameron.
Mr Barclay elevates the post from backroom to cabinet. He already serves as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the cabinet’s odd-job man. Colleagues describe the former City regulatory wonk as diligent, mild-mannered, capable and low-profile. His predecessors think he will be impossibly overloaded: the job consumes every waking hour. Many of his responsibilities will need to be carved off; he may struggle to keep up with his work as MP for North East Cambridgeshire.
A bigger problem than overwork will be accountability. A chief of staff has no individual mandate, and all his or her authority comes from the prime minister. When Mr Barclay issues an instruction to civil servants or speaks in cabinet, it risks being unclear whether he is doing so on behalf of Mr Johnson, or as a cabinet minister. Turf wars between civil-service top brass are likely, says a former cabinet minister.
A weak centre is a perennial problem of British governments. Mr Johnson’s predecessors all tried to find ways to enforce their agendas across Whitehall, with varying degrees of success. In an abbreviated report into the parties during lockdown, Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, concluded that Downing Street suffered from “fragmented and complicated” leadership structures, overloaded officials and blurred lines of accountability.
Mr Barclay is charged with setting up a new Office of the Prime Minister, with a permanent secretary, and integrating it with the Cabinet Office, which serves as the government’s co-ordination centre. But few expect him to be able to transform Mr Johnson’s government. The ultimate problem is not structures, but the culture of carelessness set by the man at the top.
Where the Buck’s Fizz stops
Mr Johnson continued his relaunch on February 8th with a mini cabinet reshuffle. It was an inward-looking affair, aimed at shoring up his position inside his party, as MPs toy with submitting letters of no confidence. Mark Spencer, the chief whip, whose grip on the party had faltered, was replaced. Jacob Rees-Mogg, an ultra-Brexiteer and self-styled eccentric, was appointed as Minister for Brexit Opportunities to appease MPs who think Mr Johnson has cooled on the project.
As the price of staying in power, Mr Johnson is granting his MPs more influence by reviving some long-defunct policy committees. The backbenches are stuffed with bored former ministers, for whom Partygate was confirmation that 20-something special advisers have too much influence in Downing Street. Andrew Griffith, Ms Mirza’s replacement, urged MPs to join Mr Johnson’s battle against the “hegemony of left-wing orthodoxy” in public life.
Meanwhile, the scandals rumble on. On February 9th, as Mr Johnson was undergoing his weekly grilling by MPs, the Daily Mirror published a photograph of him and his staff at a Christmas quiz with a bottle of fizzy wine, tinsel and crisps in shot. A further 300 party images are in the possession of the Metropolitan Police, which is investigating 12 events. Mr Griffith’s invitation may reduce the number of Tory MPs submitting letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson. It won’t reduce the number who think him a disastrous prime minister. ■
