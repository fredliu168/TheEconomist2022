ROSE GORDON is trapped. Played by Kirsten Dunst, she is swabbing a floor in the half-light when she first appears in “The Power of the Dog”. It is 1925, and the widow runs a boarding house in a one-saloon town in Montana. For their part, the Burbank brothers, Phil and George, are trapped in a gloomy ranch house and each other’s company. Jane Campion, the director, is trapped too—in her case in the moribund genre of the Western.
Or so it may seem. After George (Jesse Plemons) marries Rose, the film tells a story of strength and vulnerability, secret hurts that boil over as rage and unsayable things expressed without words. Along the way, “The Power of the Dog”—which is up for a whopping 12 Academy Awards—demonstrates the genius of the Western form, and the freedom to be found in artistic constraints.

The death of the Western has been anticipated by critics for decades. All those panning shots and wagon trails are said to be too languid for today’s audiences, who want more action and whizzier effects. The vistas are over-exposed and the politics irredeemable. Parts of the template can be tracked to other kinds of movie—to the cops and hoodlums in gangster flicks, or the frontiers explored in science fiction. But the Western itself has been declared, on and off, to be as doomed as Butch and Sundance.
It has never died, because it is an unkillably flexible genre. Natural justice versus the formal kind, the embrace of domesticity and the wide world’s allure, duels between men and callousness towards women, perilous journeys, fears faced and fled: these Western themes, all of which feature in Ms Campion’s film, will never be stale. The Western served as a commentary on McCarthyism in “High Noon” and on the Vietnam war in “The Wild Bunch”. Crucially, the meaning of its key elements can be reversed at will.
The violence at the Western’s heart can be noble or tawdry. Masculinity can be virtuous or toxic; lawmen, outlaws and avengers either righteous or sadistic. America can be a dream or a racist nightmare. Revisionism is one of the genre’s proudest traditions. It encompasses the homoeroticism of “Brokeback Mountain” and John Wayne’s old-school heroism in “Stagecoach”. Its setting is both the blasted terrain of “The Outlaw Josey Wales” and the grandeur of Monument Valley.
“The Power of the Dog” finds new depths in Western motifs—fresh dangers in the landscape and suffocation in the homestead, and a queasy affinity between villain and innocent. In the novel of 1967 on which it is based, Thomas Savage writes that Rose’s arrival at the Burbank ranch “could mean the end of the world, as Phil knew it”. Played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Phil sets out to destroy her, to that end bullying and then befriending her effete but steely son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Only now the weapons are not six-shooters but a stretch of rawhide rope, a banjo and a whistled tune.
Like the violence, time and memory are recalibrated. In lots of previous Westerns, the clock ticks down not only to a gunfight but to the demise of the West, as railroads and the government move in. Here the Old West is not just past; it is a legend, even a lie.
In the novel the ranch-hands are “all play-acting, like they saw in the moving pictures”; in the film, Mr Cumberbatch walks with a tense strut that suggests Phil is impersonating a cowboy as much as the actor is. He longs for a dead comrade named Bronco Henry, a figure more powerful for remaining off-screen. At the last, the story turns out to have been not only a Western but a murder mystery, its clues scattered lightly and the plot wound tight. The killer, you realise, gave warning of the crime, but nobody listened, as people often don’t.
For these characters, as for most people in real life, liberation lies not in running away but in making the most of constricting circumstances. Likewise, a seemingly limiting form—the self-portrait, say, or the sonnet, or the Western—can be a chance for an artist to take a personal stand. Each departure in look and feel can be an assertion of independence. The contrast with the canon redoubles the effects. In lazy hands, a genre is a shortcut or a comfort blanket; in talented ones, it is a challenge.
Ms Campion rises to it triumphantly. By rights, her film will win a ten-gallon-hatful of Oscars at the ceremony on March 27th. Then again, awards, like life, are not always fair. Or, as a character says in “Unforgiven”, another drama of rough justice that was said to have saved the Western 30 years ago: “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”
