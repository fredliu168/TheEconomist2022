Russia’s tame parliament passed a bill urging Mr Putin to recognise two breakaway statelets in eastern Ukraine. Since these statelets claim big chunks of Ukraine they do not control, this would give Mr Putin a pretext for war. He said he would not sign the bill yet. The Kremlin insisted, absurdly, that Ukraine was committing genocide against Russian-speakers. Hackers attacked Ukrainian banks and the defence ministry.

The body that represents the interests of most of London’s police officers said it had “no faith” in Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, after his sacking of Cressida Dick as police commissioner. Botched handlings of peaceful protests, a failure to grapple with abuses by cops and a fiasco in investigating lockdown-breaching parties at the heart of government had made her position untenable.
The EU announced a €150bn ($170bn) fund to invest in . The money is intended not only to promote development in Africa but also to offer an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which has funded roads, ports and railways across the continent.
