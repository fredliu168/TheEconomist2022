- Latin American politicians yearn for Utopia | The Americas | The Economist","shareSnippet":"Bello – Latin American politicians yearn for Utopia","headline":"Latin American politicians yearn for Utopia","section":"The Americas","keywords":[],"author":["The Economist"],"url":"https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/07/21/latin-american-politicians-yearn-for-utopia","type":"Article","articleBody":"When he wrote “Utopia”, a satire published in 1516, Thomas More was careful not to give an exact location for his imaginary island with its perfect society. But the reader is given to understand that it was sited off the coast of Brazil. That was hardly coincidental. \nThe idea of Utopia may be universal, but ever since Columbus and the European encounter with the Americas, which took place not long before More wrote, it has had a particular association with Latin America. This was nourished by myths of El Dorado and the Amazons; by tales of the prodigious civilisations of ancient Mexico and the Incas; and by European notions of the new world as both a natural paradise peopled by Rousseau’s “noble savage” and a blank slate on which any project could be inscribed. “We have clung to Utopia because we were founded as a Utopia, because the memory of the good society lies in our origins and also at the end of the road, as the fulfilment of our hopes,” as Carlos Fuentes, a Mexican novelist, wrote. \nThis streak continues to this day in Latin American politics. The Utopian urge is to “refound” rather than reform countries, expressed in new constitutions or the disqualification of political opponents. It often militates against the more modest but achievable goals of good government and steady progress. \nTake, for example, the proposed new constitution presented this month in Chile. With 110 articles in its chapter on “fundamental rights and guarantees” it is a detailed blueprint for an ideal society in which no one is discriminated against and everyone enjoys equality, though some more than others. It guarantees everyone the right, among other things, to “neurodiversity”, to “the free development” of “the personality, identity and life projects” and to “leisure, rest and the enjoyment of free time”. It also requires the state to promote and guarantee “the harmonious inter-relationship and respect of all symbolic, cultural and heritage expressions”. No matter that these aspirations are hopelessly woolly, are often at odds with one another and are supremely unlikely to be realised.\nOr take Colombia’s newly elected president, Gustavo Petro. Not only did he originally propose to ban all new prospecting for oil, gas and minerals in a country that relies on mining and oil for over half of its exports, but he also promised that the state would give jobs to the 11% of the labour force who are unemployed (his designated finance minister says this won’t happen). Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promises not just humdrum policy and administration but rather a “fourth transformation”, akin to his country’s independence or its revolution of 1910-17. And outsiders, from Butch Cassidy, an American train robber who died in Bolivia, to a group of German anti-vaxxers who set up a commune in the wilds of Paraguay during the pandemic, continue to see Latin America as a place to pursue their dreams undisturbed by laws or restrictions.\nThe problem with this search for Utopia is that it coexists with generally poor government. That may not be coincidental. As Carlos Granés, a Colombian essayist, has explained in “Delirio Americano”, a monumental exploration of culture and politics in Latin America in the 20th century published earlier this year, the Utopian infatuation of the region’s intellectuals with nationalism and revolution led them to disdain liberal democracy and embrace authoritarian leaders of the right or left. These impulses have hardened into a Latin American political brand. “If we renounce Utopia and revolution, what place would Latin America have in the concert of nations?” Mr Granés asked. Their cult reached its apogee with Che Guevara, liberation theology and Sub-Comandante Marcos and his Zapatista national-liberation army, with their respective examples of sacrifice and redemption through guerrilla war against imperialism, the exaltation of the poor and what Mr Granés terms “revolution as performance art”.\nThe yearning for Utopia is a response to the injustices and inequalities of Latin American societies. But it may make those problems worse. Utopia slides all too easily into a dystopia of poverty and police states, as has happened in Fidel Castro’s Cuba, Daniel Ortega’s Nicaragua and Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela. Even where it doesn’t, it can lead to frustration and reaction, as may be Chile’s fate. \nFar better for Latin America’s politicians to be honest with their people about the limits of the possible and to pursue the path of steady progress rather than the search for paradise.\nRead more from Bello, our columnist on Latin America:\nMigrant flows are changing in the Americas (Jul 14th)\nBrazil’s
