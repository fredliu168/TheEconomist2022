# Missionary creep 
##### New disclosure rules aim to better measure climate risks. Is that even possible?

From the outside, the Wilmington Club, a brownstone mansion in Wilmington, Delaware, looks like a place where time has stood still. It sits in an overgrown garden. The front door and windows let no light out from within. Step inside and the feeling is amplified: it is like entering a refuge from woke capitalism. At the bar are heavy ashtrays. A stag’s head is on the wall. A black-and-white photo celebrates the 105 whiskies ordered at a legendary dinner many years ago. Until recently, says Charles Elson, a corporate-governance expert formerly at the University of Delaware, terrapins were bred in the basement to be turned into stew.
In short, it is a convivial place for corporate lawyers in a city where the law is almost everyone’s bread and butter. Some 1.6m businesses are incorporated in Delaware, and cases decided in Wilmington quickly become the law of the land. But lately the club’s lawyers have been in as much of a stew as the terrapins. That is because esg threatens to replace the state’s long-established influence over American business with the long arm of government.

Mr Elson says the creep of federalism into the boardroom started with the Sarbanes-Oxley act in 2002. Then came the Dodd-Frank act of 2010, which mandated reporting on executive pay. Now comes an esg-related proposal from the Securities and Exchange Commission (sec) to force companies to disclose climate-related information. As Myron Steele, former chief justice of the state’s supreme court puts it, “Strictly from the Delaware perspective, the only thing worse than nuclear war is a federal mandate for corporate governance.”
The business of risk
It is not only American regulators. The International Sustainability Standards Board (issb), a newly created arm of the ifrs Foundation, aims to make non-financial disclosures as consistent as financial ones in a company’s filings. The European Union is pushing for another set of standards, the corporate-sustainability reporting directive, to become law in its 27 member countries by the end of this year. It is expected to force as many as 49,000 companies who do business within the bloc to reveal sustainability information, up from 11,600 now. S.P. Kothari of the mit Sloan School of Management half-jokingly describes the global push as a “full-employment act for accountants and consultants.”
Two forces are driving things forward. The first is a sense among regulatory bodies that climate change is too big a risk to the financial system to deal with under the old rules. As Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva, deputy general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (bis), the central bankers’ bank, puts it, financial markets are aware of the risks of climate change, but the current pricing of those risks is too low, as if global warming can be reversed by some miracle technology. “It’s not a tail risk. It is something that is certain to occur if we don’t do something about it.” 
The second is a strong conviction that shareholders want more information. “What’s changed is that investors have become much more interested in seeing the full picture,” says Sue Lloyd, vice-chair of the issb. Gary Gensler, chair of the sec, launched the climate-disclosure proposals in March saying that they had the support of investors “representing literally tens of trillions of dollars”.
The transatlantic disclosure proposals are not identical. Both the issb and the sec are proposing climate disclosures, though the issb also has proposals for more general disclosures. Ms Lloyd says its main aim is to give investors the sustainability information that they need to make an assessment of a company’s value. She describes the current situation as confusing for both companies and investors, because firms do not know what information to make available, and shareholders struggle to make sense of a plethora of data. In one of the most difficult areas, the issb is seeking feedback on how companies should report greenhouse-gas (ghg) emissions, including the so-called scope-three emissions generated by suppliers and users of their products. Disclosure will depend on how material such emissions are when assessing a company’s value, she says.
Regulatory ambitions
The sec’s proposed rule is 490 pages long and hugely ambitious. In a nutshell, it aims to mandate: disclosure on climate-related risks to a firm’s current and future business; information on any scenario plans or internal carbon prices it uses; the threat of climate-related events such as bad weather on each item in its financial statements; its ghg emissions, including scope three, if material or part of an emissions goal; and details on other climate-related targets and whether it is meeting them. If it is a big firm, these disclosures will need to be audited. 
The eu’s rules go beyond referring to information about climate change that is material for investors and aim to measure the company’s impact on people and the environment directly. This “double materiality” has given rise to what Ms Lloyd calls “a bit of an emotional debate” about whether other regulators go far enough. But she thinks it is a red herring. The perspectives do not have to be in conflict and there is commonality in the information required. For example, when a high-emitting company assesses its ghg emissions, it will have to gauge their impact on the outside world because of the risk that a regulatory, consumer or worker backlash will affect its value, she says.
Yet if in Europe the concern is that the new rules may not go far enough, in America it is that they may exceed the sec’s remit and threaten to damage the credibility of the entire financial-reporting system. That has led to some colourful dissent. Hester Peirce, the only sec commissioner to oppose the new proposals, set the tone by declaring in March: “We are not the Securities and Environment Commission—at least not yet.” She complains that some disclosure rules will affect companies whether their emissions are material or not. She says measuring climate risks is difficult to do, and that trying to drive capital flows to the right firms is a “fool’s errand” because nobody knows what effective climate solutions will emerge. 
The criticisms do not stop with her. In May the  reported that the cost of implementing the proposals was becoming a concern. It said the sec’s own estimates were that it would raise the cost to businesses to comply with the rules from $3.9bn a year to $10.2bn. There are also criticisms that the sec has listened too much to big asset managers, who reap fees from selling esg products, rather than to retail investors, who may be less keen on all the new information.
Perhaps most tangibly, critics foresee a backlash from both sides of the political divide: from the right, on the grounds that it thinks Wall Street asset managers are pushing a political agenda in the name of their clients; and from the left, where many think fighting climate change is more important than fussing about financial risks. Among the lawyers in Wilmington, the betting is that the courts will stop the sec in its tracks because its disclosure rules flout the limits to its authority. This view has been bolstered by a Supreme Court decision at the end of June to curb the power of the Environmental Protection Agency, an American regulator. It could provide legal grounds for fighting the sec on climate-related risks and ghg emissions. 
For the rules to have global impact, though, America needs to play a part. The whole point of putting forward overlapping climate-related disclosures from the issb, the sec and the eu is that they limit the burden of repetition on reporting companies, and spread the costs. As for their impact, granular and more standardised climate-risk disclosures could give investors a better handle on where the risks and opportunities lie. This could eventually help determine the risks affecting the value that they put on a company. As Mr Pereira da Silva of the bis says, such signals could help to set a “shadow price” on carbon emissions even in the absence of a government-mandated carbon price. 
The information would have to be trustworthy. That is why so many accounting firms are hiring feverishly as the gravy train approaches. pwc, one of the big four, said last year that it would spend $12bn creating 100,000 jobs, a fair portion of which will be working on esg-related issues. It is also raising the skill levels of its existing staff to help handle these matters. Alan McGill, a sustainability expert at pwc in Britain, gives a sense of the mission-driven zeal that the mandatory reporting now plays into. “Every six weeks that passes is 1% of the decade gone, so the time to act is disappearing,” he says.
Whether fearmongering helps is open to debate. Whether it is even possible accurately to forecast the financial impact of something as unprecedented as the future effects of climate change also remains to be seen. But for all the misgivings, it is hard to see this regulatory juggernaut stopping in its tracks. It may be better to think of how the rules can be finessed to give investors better information not just about the future of the companies they own, but also how to mitigate their impact on the planet.■
