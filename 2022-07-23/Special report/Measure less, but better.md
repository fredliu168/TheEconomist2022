# Measure less, but better 
##### It’s the environment, stupid

Last year Vivek Ramaswamy, a health-care entrepreneur, published “Woke Inc”, a rollicking polemic against the passion of American ceos to pat themselves on the back for tackling such issues as climate change, racism and workers’ rights. He argued that, however fractured governments are, such problems are the job of politicians to fix. In the hands of business elites, a concept like esg might be well-intentioned. But it threatens to subvert the integrity of democracy, Mr Ramaswamy suggested.
Other critics of esg make a similar point about carbon taxes. They say that offering a feel-good alternative to investors, financiers, big business and regulators, aka, “the climate-industrial complex”, may give an excuse to governments not to charge for carbon emissions. It is a legitimate concern. Carbon taxes would be the best way to direct investment to the most promising decarbonising technologies. Yet nobody should be fooled. The main reason the taxes are both low and insufficiently co-ordinated across the world is not because of esg or woke capitalism. It is because politicians are too timid to foist them on voters. 
In fact it is worth doubling down on private-sector and bureaucratic efforts to get companies to measure and reduce their carbon emissions. It may be a second-best solution. But with the right disclosure requirements and regulatory scrutiny, it could help direct capital where it is best needed. And if governments ever muster up the courage to beef up carbon levies, good measurement would make them more effective. 
As this special report has argued, esg has too often been neither a good measurement tool nor an effective risk-management one. It aims to satisfy so many stakeholders that the information it elicits often bears little relevance to what a company actually does. It is too imprecise to be a shadow tax on a company’s negative externalities. It has created confusion for companies. And it is hard for investors to work out what it means for asset prices.
Moreover, it is infected with moral judgments that change with the weather. As researchers at the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School have pointed out, esg measurement is mixed up with diametrically opposed views on the purpose of the company, as well as debates over whether shareholders or stakeholders should prevail in decision-making. That amplifies arguments over what is a “good” or “bad” company.
In contrast, the profit-and-loss accounting system that it aims to supplement is a model of clarity, eschewing moral judgments and political influence. Accounting boards have shown the value of standardised, audited financial statements for the development of capital markets, economic growth and as checks on the way managers run companies. Sustainability disclosures should try to follow a similar path. 
To make esg measurement more effective it must be streamlined. Standard-setters should not impose measurements to satisfy every interest group or asset manager’s pet social cause. Instead, they should try to ensure that non-financial disclosures are required only if they are material to an industry. Measures of more general relevance can be disclosed voluntarily, as they are via the Global Reporting Initiative.
The asset-management industry should customise its offerings. It should make products better tailored to particular investor constituencies: climate funds for people who want to reduce carbon emissions, social funds for those interested in human capital; and governance funds for those worried about mismanagement. If it wants to sell products that put sustainability ahead of all other considerations, they should be marketed as “impact” funds, without reckless promises of high returns. If investment managers persist in introducing esg criteria across the span of their portfolios, they should surrender voting rights to ordinary shareholders to make them more representative. That should steer them away from dangerous forays into the culture wars.
Streamlining need not mean shrinkage. In fact, more focused metrics could be promoted globally to encompass private companies and government entities, especially in emerging markets which have the most to do in cutting carbon emissions. It may be better to focus on the e side of esg, and not the s or the g. In many non-Anglo-Saxon countries, there are impediments to basing investment decisions on the latter two, given information controls. Regulators, including the sec, are for now focused exclusively on climate-related disclosures. 
Ideally, the term esg should be scrapped. As an amalgam of three words, environmental, social and governance, which sound more like a pious mantra than a force for change, its reputation is now tarnished. That may worsen if outflows continue as returns deteriorate. Yet sustainable investing is not about to disappear. More regulation may make it more credible. So would more policing of net-zero commitments. Investors will continue to care not just about returns but about the world they live in. With a suitable new name—say, natural-capital investing—there is no reason why a blend of climate and capitalism should not prove useful. Provided it is not hyped far beyond what it can actually achieve.■
