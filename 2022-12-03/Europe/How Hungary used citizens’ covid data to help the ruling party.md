IN DECEMBER 2020, when Hungary’s health authority set up a website for citizens to register for covid-19 vaccinations, it included a tick-box for those who wanted to receive further information. Gabor Toka, a political-science professor, found it odd that the box did not specify that future communications should be about covid. To see what would happen, he ticked the box for his own registration but left it unticked for his mother’s. Some months later, when Hungary’s general-election campaign swung into gear, he found that he (but not his mother) started to get campaign emails from the ruling party, Fidesz.
Mr Toka was not the only one. A report published on December 1st by Human Rights Watch suggests that Fidesz seems to have gained access to state databases and used them to send campaign messages to voters. In addition to emails, people got phone calls and text messages from Fidesz candidates urging them to vote and reminding them what a wonderful job the government was doing. 
Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, has been erasing the boundaries between the state and Fidesz ever since coming to power in 2010. He has used his two-thirds majority in parliament to overhaul the constitution and pack the courts with sympathetic judges. Friendly businessmen have taken over nearly all of the country’s media outlets and put most of them under the control of a foundation whose board is appointed by Fidesz members. Before elections, Mr Orban routinely has the government’s information office stage “national consultations”: bogus surveys which ask every citizen biased questions, such as whether they support showing explicit sexual content to children, implying that the opposition does.
Abusing databases for campaign purposes, however, violates both EU and Hungarian laws on data privacy. Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation rules out even some practices that are routine in American politics. Preserving lists of individual voters’ surveyed preferences in previous elections, for example, is illegal unless they have given their consent. Fidesz is understood to keep an immense database going back to 2004, known as the Kubatov list after a party official.
Some Hungarians complained about such practices during the campaign, to little effect. The National Electoral Commission ruled in February that the government information office had broken no rules with its emails praising the government’s Ukraine policies. The supreme court said the emails went too far, but imposed only a procedural fine. Hungary’s constitutional court, mostly appointed by Fidesz, then overturned that ruling: after all, it reasoned, the war was an important issue and the office’s duty was to inform citizens.
The report documents apparent violations of data-privacy rules by the opposition as well. The main opposition parties formed a coalition during the election campaign in the hope of unseating Mr Orban. The parties set up a new joint database of contact information collected with voters’ consent for this campaign, which was not to be merged with their separate party databases (and was to be deleted after the election). But some voters were contacted by parties they had not provided consent to, suggesting the data was not in fact properly cordoned off.
Yet the scale of the data available to Fidesz and the government dwarfs anything the other parties could put together. The joint opposition’s pre-election signature campaign, which it used to build its voter database, reached some 800,000 people, of whom a third agreed to be contacted. The health authority’s covid contact list alone contained information about 6.5m citizens, about two-thirds of Hungary’s population. Using ministries for campaign purposes, while also dominating the mainstream media, helped Fidesz win a  in April’s election: it took 54% of the vote to the opposition’s 34%.
There were many reasons for the opposition’s defeat. Their candidate for prime minister never managed to connect well with voters, and the parties, an ideologically incoherent collection ranging across the political spectrum, spent too much time arguing among themselves, leading to confusion about how they might govern had they won. But Mr Orban’s outrageous use of government resources to campaign doubtless played a part. ■
