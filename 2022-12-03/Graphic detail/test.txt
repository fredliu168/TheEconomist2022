England pummelled Iran 6-2, and Spain obliterated Costa Rica 7-0.\nSupporters of the victors surely enjoyed such lopsided wins, but might downplay their significance. Should a bevy of goals against one weak opponent really change perceptions of a team’s chances at a title? Our study finds that the answer is “yes”.\nNational sides play rarely, forcing analysts to make do with scant data. Of England’s nine matches (excluding friendlies) this year, three were in the World Cup—enough to justify re-evaluating the team.\nBut updating expectations using small samples requires careful adjustments. In the group stage, the average strength of a team’s opponents varies widely. The Netherlands had a glide path to the knockout stage in 2022, facing two middle-ranking teams and Qatar, a weakling. In contrast, the deck was stacked against Costa Rica, whose group includes Spain and Germany.\nTo account for such disparities, we used Elo, a statistical team-rating system. For each group-stage match since 1998, we first calculated a predicted goal margin based on the sides’ Elo scores entering the tournament. We then identified teams whose results exceeded these expectations.\n\n\n\nFor example, in 2002 Germany had the ninth-best Elo score. Its group-stage rivals were eighth, 18th and 28th. Based on these ratings, Germany should have outscored its opponents by one goal in total. Thanks to an 8-0 drubbing of Saudi Arabia, it beat this benchmark by nine. In the knockout stage, Germany’s rivals had also exceeded group-stage forecasts—but only by 2.6 goals, leaving a gap of 6.4 in the Germans’ favour. They went on to reach the final.\nThis case reflects a trend. In the knockout stage, teams that have beaten predicted scoring margins in the group stage tend to overperform. Those with weak group-stage results often suffer early exits. In the round of 16 in 2018, Spain, ranked third in Elo, faced Russia, which was 28th. But Spain’s group-stage scoring margin was two goals below expected. Russia’s was four higher, a gap of six favouring Russia. Spain lost.\n\n\n\nAlthough we tried predicting knockout matches with group-stage wins, losses and draws, we got more accurate forecasts using scoring margins. This means that it does indeed improve a side’s estimated title chances more to win 7-0 than 2-1. Overall, we found that teams carry to the knockout stage about a quarter of their group-stage goal difference above expectation.\nSo far, England’s and Spain’s goal margins are both 5.3 above expected (Spain had one group-stage match left as The Economist went to press). This implies that they should beat Elo’s knockout-stage forecasts by 0.45 goals per game—the gap between a solid side like Switzerland and a plausible champion like Portugal. This would elevate Spain to the level of Brazil, the favourite, and lift England into the top four.■\nChart sources: World Football Elo Ratings; Kaggle; The Economist","description":"Teams that pummel even weak opponents fare surprisingly well later on","articleDescription":"Teams that pummel even weak opponents fare surprisingly well later on","imageUrl":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20221203_WOT941.png","imageHeight":720,"imageWidth":1280,"datePublished":"2022-12-01T15:04:33Z","dateModified":"2022-12-01T19:58:12Z","dateCreated":"2022-11-30T13:22:45Z","isPrintArticle":true,"printEdition":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","copyrightYear":2022,"dateline":"","inLanguage":"en","interactive":true,"scripts":["https://infographics.economist.com1","https://infographics.economist.com1","https://infographics.economist.com1"],"css":[]},"sectionArticles":[{"id":"/content/1u6b2n7blf2gr79m4ee72n4k97tvhhso","publication":[{"id":"/content/5gkcciopitck0ing7tq6ur4fmh2gr75a","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/4deqjokvuv848j4l58a4ou8i9mgn5d4o","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/4cmnn18848hl5vchmj0gac2r3nc0glch","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/6ld7b0fsttnmpk5rhc9dvgq627tbd3ah","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/1ogmslfirlqfvfq0b8jhvu822rf0vpt8","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/23ad4iceavtiaajaknep5sglh6r2mf6j","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/r3tc6qhgqoj0s9loqr696tbalfdts9j1","context":{"position":2000.72,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"}],"headline":"The World Cup’s group stage bodes well for Spain and England","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/12/01/the-world-cups-group-stage-bodes-well-for-spain-and-england","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content"}]},[],{"shouldDropPaywall":false},{"section1":{"id":"/content/omi23dr8h15h8c33t2gkb2cju8ap758o","type":["Blog"],"headline":"Podcasts","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","hasPart":{"parts":[{"headline":"Will Germany succeed in transforming its foreign policy?","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2022/12/01/will-germany-succeed-in-transforming-its-foreign-policy","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20221203_PDP511.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media","promo":null}},{"headline":"“Xi Jinping will be thinking, ‘at last, I’m completely in charge;
