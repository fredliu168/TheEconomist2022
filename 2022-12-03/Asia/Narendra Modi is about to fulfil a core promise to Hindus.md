# Narendra Modi is about to fulfil a core promise to Hindus 
##### But building a temple at Ayodhya is easier than building an economy

AYODHYA, a town on a tributary of the Ganges, is believed to have been the birthplace, 7,000 years ago, of Lord Ram, a major Hindu god. Evidence of the divine event is naturally wanting. “Only four things remain here of that era: the name of the lord, the soil on which we stand, the river that flows alongside, and the faith of the devout,” Ajay Kumar Pandey, a local resident with “Lord Ram” daubed on his forehead, told Banyan during a visit to the town this week.
Undeterred by that lacuna, on December 6th, 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a 16th-century mosque that they believed had been erected by Muslim invaders on the precise spot where Lord Ram was born. Egged on by members of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), this act of desecration sparked riots across north and west India in which over 2,000 people died. It also laid the ground for the rise of the BJP as a national force. Which, in due course, led to the premiership of Narendra Modi, who won election in 2014 in part by promising to build a Ram temple on the site of the destroyed mosque. As the 30th anniversary of its demolition approaches, your columnist wanted to gauge his progress. 
After a long legal battle, India’s Supreme Court ruled three years ago that though the mosque’s destruction was “an egregious violation of the rule of law”, Hindus could still build a temple where it had stood. The temple, which is being paid for with public and private money, is scheduled to open in early 2024, a few months before India’s next general election. A vast monument constructed in marble, sandstone and teak, it will contain three storeys and 392 pillars. But for now it is a building-site, mainly visible from a makeshift shrine erected nearby.
Security is heavy. Before gaining admission to the shrine, devotees must deposit their belongings in lockers far from it, then queue for three rounds of frisking. Beyond the checkposts, the pathway is guarded by bored-looking paramilitary troops toting automatic weapons. Then, at a point along a mesh-wire-fenced walkway, the expansive plinth of a what will soon be a soaring stone edifice comes into view. The crowd whoops at the first glimpse, chanting “Victory to Lord Ram”. For many, the sight of the construction is at least as inspiring as the shrine.
The temple will be the fulfilment of a promise that has been at the heart of bjp politics for more than three decades, and Mr Modi will claim huge credit for it. An early agitator for the temple, he laid its foundation stone and last inspected the site in October, ahead of Diwali. He has helped realise other cherished Hindu dreams, too. He has robbed the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir of its special status. Muslim men’s hideous custom of granting themselves an instant divorce has been criminalised. So what comes next? 
An optimist might imagine Mr Modi and his party pocketing their Hindu nationalist triumphs and focusing on the other main pillar of their policy agenda: economic development. Ayodhya also illustrates the desperate need for that. Locals complain that the town lacks basic services such as clean water, medical facilities and garbage disposal. Surveys have consistently found that most Indians care far more about such economic matters than religious ones. In a recent poll of voters in Uttar Pradesh (up), the vast northern state that includes Ayodhya, 74% considered inflation and development very important issues, while only 40% said the same of the Ram temple. If Mr Modi set Hindu populism aside and focused ruthlessly on such matters, he could be great.
A realist must reluctantly consider that unlikely. Because, as Ayodhya ultimately shows, it is much easier to build a temple than an economy. And if only a sizeable minority of Indians care deeply about such gestures, they are easily sufficient to put their champion in power. Mr Modi won a historic parliamentary majority in 2019 with 37% of the vote.
Moreover, even if the prime minister wished to set Hindu rabble-rousing aside (for which there is no evidence), the Hindu activist network he emerged from will not. Its members have their sights fixed on a 17th-century mosque in Varanasi, built on the site of an older Hindu temple, and on other Muslim sites around the country. Even the iconic Qutb Minar, a 12th-century minaret in Delhi, may be imperilled. The Ram temple at Ayodhya was for the bjp never a concrete or isolated issue. It was a blueprint for winning power. And Mr Modi will keep that plan to hand long after Ayodhya’s giant Ram temple opens for prayer. ■
