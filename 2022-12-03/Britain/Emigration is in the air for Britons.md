# Emigration is in the air for Britons 
##### Plenty of people want to come to Britain. But lots also want to leave

Adverts on TalkSport, a radio station that does what it says on the tin, reveal the state of the nation. McDonald’s advertises for workers in Britain’s tight labour market. Santander, a bank, warns against falling victim to fraud, which is rife. Amid it all, the government desperately reminds listeners that it has already knocked £400 ($480) off their energy bills. 
But every 15 minutes the listener is treated to an alternative. “Build a life in Western Australia,” blares out a man with a questionable Aussie accent. “Find the work and lifestyle you want in Western Australia.” White Van Man is implored to ditch Britain and head 9,000 miles (14,500km) south-east for a new life in Perth, which has sunshine and jobs galore in construction and manufacturing. It is, says the jobbing actor, “the lifestyle you deserve”. 
Migration policy in Britain is framed almost entirely by people arriving. More attention should be paid to those on the way out. In the year to June 2022, over 1m people entered Britain. But people come and go. About 560,000 left the country in the same period, as immigrants returned home to the eu and beyond, and Britons took a punt on starting a new life elsewhere. Unless things improve, many more will follow. 
Historically, Britain is a country of emigration rather than immigration. During the 19th century only Ireland, Italy and Norway exported people at a higher rate. The history of those who arrived from the Caribbean on  in 1948 is well known. The tales of the millions of Britons who boarded the  and other ocean liners for a new life in Australia and beyond is overlooked, argues David Edgerton, a historian. Britain only became a country of predominantly net immigration in 1983.
When emigration last haunted politicians, Britain was in a rut. In 1974 Jim Callaghan, then the foreign secretary and a future prime minister, joked: “Sometimes when I go to bed at night, I think that if I were a young man I would emigrate.” After all, Britain was a country with stagnant growth, high inflation, high taxes, an energy crisis and a state in dramatic need of overhaul. 
The circumstances that had Callaghan dreaming of life elsewhere then are similar to today’s. Young, potentially mobile workers have it hardest. Graduate-trainee salaries have fallen by 22% in real terms since 2010, according to High Fliers, a graduate-recruitment research agency. An uneven tax system whacks thrusting youngsters. Overall the British state has a smaller tax take than its European neighbours. But those on a typical professional salary with a student loan face marginal rates (41%) similar to those in continental Europe and higher than in Australia and Canada. 
People leave when opportunity lies elsewhere. The realisation that Britain is not, by north European standards, a rich country is entering the country’s bloodstream. British gdp per person is now below countries it used to rival, whether Germany, Australia or Canada. Britain’s comparison country is increasingly Italy, a country where it is the norm for young people to leave, rather than an exception. In a few years’ time the point of comparison may be Poland, which thanks to tearaway growth, is always gagging for workers. In the 1980s “Auf Wiedersehen, Pet”, a TV comedy about a group of Geordie builders working in Germany, became a hit. A 2030 remake might be titled “Do Widzenia, Pet”. 
For now, the last ones in are the first ones out. A net influx of eu citizens has turned into an exodus. Fanny, a 25-year-old Frenchwoman who graduated from the London School of Economics in 2020, is one. Of the roughly 20 French students on her course, she was one of only two to stick around. Now she too is departing, after taking a job in Marseille. Her salary will be the same in net terms but instead of paying for a room in a dingy flatshare in east London, it will stretch to a one-bed flat. If a job in London, where British salaries are highest, requires living in a flat-share until your 30s no wonder people consider going elsewhere.
Those with the easiest path of departure are the most likely to take it. Doctors possess a golden ticket: few countries turn them away. Given wages have dropped by 10% in real terms since 2010 and working conditions are worsening, it is little surprise that many doctors leave. Half of the 10,000 doctors who stopped practising in 2021 intended to go abroad (about 120,000 doctors work in the NHS in England). One in three doctors trained in Britain go on to leave the country, according to a survey by the General Medical Council. Britain has become a temperate Philippines, churning out health-care workers who head elsewhere. 
The emigrant song 
At this point in the political and economic cycle, all sides are fed up. Labourites despair; Europhiles seethe that their life’s work has been smashed up; Brexiteers moan that the country is closer to London-sur-Seine than Singapore-on-Thames. Meanwhile, a recession looms. It is natural for people to think of leaving. But talk about a new life abroad is often just that. Actually doing it is tricky. Visas must be obtained, job offers secured, flights booked, bureaucracies navigated, homes found and friends made. The history of migration is the history of the vast majority of people staying put. 
Yet emigration from Britain slowed only when destination countries such as Australia tightened their immigration policies. Now, after years of lockdowns, gaps in labour markets have become canyons and the likes of Australia and Canada are gagging for arrivals, as TalkSport listeners can attest. When immigration to Britain hits 1m, the government panics. When Canada reached the same relative rate this year, its government boasted.
Things in Britain can improve. But if not, leaving is once again an option. In 1978, a year before she defeated Callaghan in an election, Margaret Thatcher told a dining companion about her plans if she did not win: “We’ll always stay…but we’ll work very hard with the children to set them up with careers in Canada.” Emigration has long been a British solution to British malaise. ■
