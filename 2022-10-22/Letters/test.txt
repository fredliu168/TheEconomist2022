The staggering number of bells lost during the second world war speaks to the plundering of identity and soul that made the Nazi occupation so catastrophic. \nBells aren’t chunks of bronze waiting to be plucked like fruit from a tree for a more industrious purpose. They are the very heartbeat of towns and villages the world over. The exact tone, timbre and resonance of a single bell or chime cannot be replicated once lost. Bells are an intrinsic part of cultural heritage, an aural and artistic link to an exact moment in history. \nIn an age where Benin bronzes, Italian marbles and Cambodian sandstones are being repatriated, and rightfully so, it seems incongruous that bells should be shuffled around without considered pause. Where possible, bells should be rehoused in the communities they have served for centuries. \nVolodymyr Zelensky enjoined the audience at this year’s Grammy Awards to fill the silence left by bombs with music. A silence lay on Germany after 1945. The bells that survived should remain to give witness to the indefatigable human spirit, regardless of whether church attendance may wax or wane.\nPaul Ashe\nDirector\nNational Bell Festival\nWashington, DC\nDetroit’s diversification \n\nYou inadvertently offered a “Back to the Future” path for Detroit, by stating that “In the long run, the only way to fully reverse Detroit’s decline is to diversify its economy” (“Revving up”, September 24th). The city’s diversification was recognised in 1969 by Jane Jacobs, in “The Economy of Cities”. Jacobs contrasted Detroit’s dynamic ecosystem of small producers to the stagnation of Pittsburgh’s steel-dominated economy. The intervening decades have been tough for Detroit, but perhaps its DNA will help it recover its former prosperity. \nDavid Zetland\nLecturer in political economy\nLeiden University College\nThe Hague\n\nIn defence of Jair Bolsonaro\nIt is truly puzzling that The Economist does not support Jair Bolsonaro for re-election as president of Brazil (“On a knife-edge”, October 8th). Mr Bolsonaro defends property rights and free-market policies, and yet you favour the leftist, socialist candidate. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was convicted of crimes and got out of jail on a legal technicality. He denies wrongdoing, but he was never found not guilty of corruption. Nor is he the pragmatic leftist you make him out to be. Lula’s government, in power from 2003 to 2010, leaned increasingly left as the years went by. His party is allied with the Movimento Sem Terra, a radical movement pushing for land reform. The threat of land invasions is real.  \nUnder the Lula government, funds were sent to Cuba and Venezuela,  “investments” that eventually became worthless and yet were financed by Brazilian taxpayers. A new Lula government would eventually trend towards ever more left-leaning policies, and increase the tax burden to finance them with consequences for the private sector and the overall  economy. \nYou think Mr Bolsonaro should lose the election. Many of your readers would disagree. A victory for Mr Bolsonaro would show that Brazilians are voting against corruption and  rejecting the kind of socialist policies that have ruined other Latin American economies such as Argentina, Cuba and Venezuela. \nPriscilla Lima\nRye, New York\nArmenia responds\nAs you point out, Azerbaijani guns, as well as the continued brutality and demonisation of Armenians, are doing the talk on the ground and domestically, while Baku presents itself as a champion of sustained peace (“The guns do the talking”, September 24th). But is Azerbaijan interested in a peace agreement and, if so, in what kind of peace? Azerbaijan’s idea of peace is an imposed agreement, which means give me what I want, otherwise I will get it by force. Its soldiers continue to commit war crimes on Armenian prisoners of war and civilians. The recent barbarous, Daesh-style mutilation of Armenian female soldiers, and cold-blooded execution of unarmed prisoners by Azerbaijani soldiers are the latest examples of such heinous crimes.\nAs the world has seen in recent years, autocratic governments, such as Azerbaijan, have complete disregard for international law, denial of basic rights of their own societies and others. While Azerbaijan ignores international law, the international community has tolerated Baku’s use of military force. Azerbaijan continues to threaten Armenia with further aggression.\nSince September 14th, the American, European Union, French and other governments have called upon Azerbaijan to withdraw its forces from Armenia’s internationally recognised borders. The role of the international community is critical. A sustainable peace requires mutual compromise and not maximalist demands. Ultimately, the choice is between defending democracy and human rights versus enabling an authoritarian regime.\nVaruzhan Nersesyan\nAmbassador of Armenia\nLondon\n\nThey’re here to help\nI was surprised to see you omitting the larger societal role that consultants fill in your criticism of management-consulting firms (“Bulletproof suits”, October 8th). Consultants are to the service economy what the means of production were to the industrial age. Occasionally consultants are called on to sprinkle holy water on a management decision, but more often than not, they are employed to help companies solve the issue of how to do more with less. \nIn an economy where there is a war for talent, constraints on resources and capital, and a fight for a reasonable return, consultants are a way, often the only way, for companies to hire the short-term manpower mixed with highly specialised advice needed to meet stakeholder expectations.\nSebastian Belmark\nManager\nFinance and Performance\nDeloitte\nCopenhagen\nThe work of both McKinsey and Bain in South Africa was represented as fairly prosaic profiteering in your article. That isn’t the case. The announcement that McKinsey is to face trial in South Africa, among the first cases to result from a  judicial commission of inquiry into state capture, indicates how extraordinary its alleged criminal conduct is considered to be. \nAnd Bain in effect destroyed the South African Revenue Service (SARS). The impact was almost immediate. Revenue collection fell precipitously, especially devastating in a country of so many poor reliant on public services. Illicit activity, previously curbed by the agency’s investigative and enforcement capacities, exploded. \nLegal charges don’t quite capture the magnitude of harm done. Now South Africa tries rather woefully to put distance between itself and the “failing state” moniker. But it wasn’t always so. In many respects SARS was considered a global model, filled with exceptionally committed, skilled public servants. It showed what was possible in a democratic South Africa. It was gutted; many of those public servants’ lives ruined. Bain did that.\nNicole Fritz\nHelen Suzman Foundation\nJohannesburg\n\nYour piece reminded me of an old story. A shepherd was tending his flock when a shiny silver BMW emerged. The driver, a young man in an Armani suit and the latest Polarised sunglasses, asked the shepherd, “If I can tell you how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?” The shepherd glanced at his peacefully grazing flock and answered, “Sure.” \nThe driver plugged his microscopic phone into a laptop and surfed to a satellite-navigation system. While the computer was busy, he sent some emails via his iPhone and, after a few minutes, nodded solemnly at the responses. Finally, he downloaded a 150-page report and pronounced to the shepherd, “You have exactly 1,586 sheep.”\n“Impressive. One of my sheep is yours,” said the shepherd. The young man selected an animal. Then the shepherd said, “If I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my sheep?” The young man replied “You’re on.” “You are a consultant,” said the shepherd without hesitation. That’s correct,” said the young man, impressed. “How ever did you guess?” “It wasn’t a guess,” replied the shepherd. “You drive into my field uninvited. You ask me to pay you for information I already know, answer questions I haven’t asked, and you know nothing about my business.\nNow give me back my dog.” \nPeter Higgins\nTalent, Oregon\nI recall a Despair, Inc (Google: despair, consulting) calendar title that defined consulting as, “If You’re Not a Part of the Solution, There’s Good Money to be Made in Prolonging the Problem.”\nWarren Peterson\nSeattle","description":"A selection of correspondence","articleDescription":"A selection of
