One year ago, 82% of Americans aged 80 or older had already been jabbed. In 2021 this group clawed back almost all the loss of le it accounted for in 2020.

A new study in Nature Human Behaviour shows that among 16 countries in 1900-45, for each country-year pair in which life expectancy (le) fell there were 1.65 where it rose. By 1946-2019, this ratio grew to 3.9 to one.\nCovid-19 disrupted this trend of ever-longer lifespans. The paper, whose lead author is Jonas Schöley of the Max Planck Institute in Germany, compiled data on death rates by age group in 28 countries, mostly in Europe. The study then calculated how long a newborn baby could expect to live if its odds of dying at each age matched the national average in a given year. By this measure, le fell in 26 of 28 countries in 2020. The average drop was nine months.\nLast year marked a return to rising le—in western Europe. At the start of 2021, only Denmark and Norway had avoided a decline in le, while Finland came close. A year later, le in Belgium, France, Sweden and Switzerland had bounced back roughly to the level of 2019. Seven more countries in the region recovered part of their losses.\nIn contrast, 2021 was grimmer than 2020 in eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia, le declines accelerated in covid’s second year. They probably did as well in Russia (for which data were not available), based on The Economist’s estimates of excess deaths. Among non-European countries, the main outlier was America, where le fell by two years in 2020 and a further three months last year.\n\n\n\nThese divergences closely reflect covid-vaccination patterns. Most countries in the study with high take-up were in western Europe. Those with the lowest rates were mainly former communist countries. \nThe impact of vaccines stood out even more when changes in le were broken down by age. One year ago, 82% of Americans aged 80 or older had already been jabbed. In 2021 this group clawed back almost all the loss of le it accounted for in 2020. America’s le decline last year was instead driven by younger victims. Vaccine hesitancy probably played a role, but so did factors other than covid, such as opioids. Even before 2020, death rates for middle-aged Americans were already rising.\n\n\n\nThis age-based pattern also appeared elsewhere. In Austria, the Netherlands, Scotland and Slovenia death rates fell in 2021 for people aged at least 80, but rose among those aged 40-59 and 60-79. The middle-aged still make up a small share of deaths from covid. But the gap between them and older people has narrowed, because they are less likely to get jabbed and more prone to risky behaviour.■\nAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub.\nChart sources: “Life expectancy changes since covid-19”, by J.
