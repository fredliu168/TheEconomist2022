In  inflation headed in the other direction, accelerating to a 41-year high of 11.1%. Food prices rose by 16%, the most in 45 years. The cost of gas and electricity was also up sharply again. The British economy contracted in the third quarter, by 0.2% over the previous three months, on cue for the start of a long recession that the Bank of England has forecast. All food for thought for the British government, as it unveiled its plan to plug a fiscal hole in the public purse. 
 also shrank in the third quarter, by 0.3%. A weak yen has pushed up the price of imports, curtailing consumption by households and businesses. Even so the contraction was a surprise; most economists were expecting modest growth in the quarter. 
China announced a set of measures to boost liquidity in the troubled , such as extending deadlines for loans to developers. The package is seen as the most significant attempt yet by the Chinese authorities to bail out the sector, which is burdened by debt and falling sales.

It now expects sales in the Christmas quarter to be lower than in the same three months last year. 
 share price struggled to recover from the hammering it took after reporting another huge quarterly investment loss at its two Vision Funds, this time of ¥1.38trn ($9.8bn). The Japanese conglomerate did manage to make an overall net profit, in part by selling off a large chunk of its stake in Alibaba. 
There was more bad news for employees at tech firms, which are culling staff numbers after a period of expansion during the pandemic. One large hedge-fund investor in  called on it to reduce its staff count and cut the salaries it pays to non-engineers. Alphabet hired 36,000 people over the past 12 months, increasing its workforce by 25%.  was preparing to lay off 10,000 people, mainly in corporate jobs. 
None but the brave
