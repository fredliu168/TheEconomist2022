The  raised its benchmark interest rate by another three-quarters of a percentage point, to a range of between 3% and 3.25%. It was the third consecutive such increase and came after figures showed that inflationary pressures are moving extensively beyond food, energy and goods to services prices, such as rent. The Fed now projects the rate to rise to at least 4.25% by the end of the year. Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chairman, said “We have to get inflation behind us”, and that there was no painless way to do so. 
Other central banks also tightened monetary policy at an aggressive pace to battle inflation. The  lifted its benchmark rate by half a percentage point, to 2.25%, the highest it has been since 2008 (three members of the nine-person Monetary Policy Committee voted for a rise of three-quarters of a percentage point).  raised its key rate to 0.5% from -0.25%, ending seven years of negative rates.

The German government nationalised , Germany’s biggest gas importer, to prevent it from collapsing. Uniper had been forced to turn to the more expensive spot market when Russia curtailed its gas supplies, leading to huge losses. The German government also took control of three refineries operated by , Russia’s biggest oil company, to secure Germany’s energy supply ahead of an eu embargo on Russian oil. 
In Britain the government introduced a scheme that will cut  for businesses by around half over the winter by capping the wholesale price of electricity and gas, an extension of the huge financial support it had earlier promised for households.

Adobe says the deal will spur growth prospects, but investors are not sure about the combination of legacy software tools with a nimble web-based application. Competition authorities, too, may have a problem with Adobe taking over an innovative rival.
