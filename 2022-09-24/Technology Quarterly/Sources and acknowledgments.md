Acknowledgements
Many people and firms contributed their time to explaining their work, and that of the field more broadly. My heartfelt thanks goes to everyone who gave their time. In addition I would particularly like to thank Kate Bingham, Bob Langer, Jeremy Levin, The Women’s Brain Project, Alzheimer’s Research UK, Steve Gardner, Daniel Karlin, Jonathan Behr, and Henrik Zetterberg. The inspiration for this piece traces back to a chat over lunch in 2019 with Frances Jensen, a professor of neurology. Thank you.
