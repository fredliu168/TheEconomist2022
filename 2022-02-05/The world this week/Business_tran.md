Investors reacted negatively to the latest quarterly earnings from Meta. Facebook’s parent company cautioned that its revenue growth would slow because of more competition for eyeballs, especially from TikTok, which is more trendy among younger users of social media. Facebook’s app lost users in America, its most lucrative market for advertising, which contributed to its first-ever loss of users globally on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Meta also broke out the numbers for its Reality Labs unit for the first time. The driving force behind the company’s ambitions for the metaverse made a $3.3bn operating loss.
Boom and bust

Meta’s warning along with poor earnings from PayPal and more concerns about the health of Sony’s video-game business, overshadowed a rebound in battered tech stocks on the back of solid profits from America’s other tech giants. Apple’s quarterly net profit was up by a fifth, year on year, as it made $124bn in revenue, a company record. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, saw sales and profit both rise by a third, driven by digital ad spending.
Trying to address those concerns about its business,  Sony said it  buying Bungie, a video-game developer best known for the “Destiny” series of games. The deal follows the recent $69bn bid by Microsoft (Sony’s arch-rival in the games business) for Activision Blizzard.
Citrix, which provides cloud computing and networking services, agreed to sell itself to a couple of investment firms in a $16.5bn transaction. It is one of the biggest-ever private buyouts of a publicly traded tech company. Similar deals could be in the offing if the shine stays off tech stocks.
The digital-currency project originally proposed by Facebook (now Meta) came to an end, when the association that governs it sold its remaining assets to a bank specialising in cryptocurrencies. Facebook launched Libra in 2019 to much fanfare, claiming it would revolutionise payment systems. Regulators around the world criticised the plan, a backlash that caused many of its big sponsors, such as PayPal, to withdraw their support. In a statement Diem, as the project is now known, said it would start to wind down, but hoped its efforts had inspired future crypto projects.
Annual inflation in the euro zone rose to 5.1% in January, another record high. Energy prices were up by 29% compared with the same month last year. The currency bloc’s economy grew by 5.2% in 2021; output is now back at pre-pandemic levels. French GDP expanded by 7% over the year, the best performance in 52 years.
Turkey’s annual inflation rate soared to 48.7%. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has forced through a number of interest-rate cuts that have contributed to rising prices. A few days before the data were released Mr Erdogan fired the head of the agency that produces the inflation statistics, his latest sacking of an economics official.
OPEC+, which includes Russia, decided to stick with the  in oil production agreed to last year, ignoring pleas from America and other countries to increase output at a faster rate in order to tame soaring energy prices, which are fuelling inflation. Brent crude has traded at $90 a barrel for the first time in years. ExxonMobil, meanwhile, reported an annual profit of $23bn, its best since 2014.
A judge in Britain ruled in favour of Hewlett-Packard in its civil fraud claims against Mike Lynch. HP bought Autonomy, a British software firm founded by Mr Lynch, in 2011 for $10.3bn. The next year HP stunned markets when it said it had been deceived about Autonomy’s performance (HP took an $8.8bn write-down). The legal saga isn’t over. Mr Lynch is now appealing against the British government’s decision to extradite him to America to face criminal fraud charges.
Like a hurricane
Spotify  to batten down its content-moderation policy, after Neil Young and Joni Mitchell withdrew their songs from the platform claiming covid misinformation had been broadcast on the Joe Rogan show, Spotify’s most-streamed podcast. As the storm raged on (Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson indicated his support for Mr Rogan), Spotify said it would add an “advisory” to any podcast that discusses covid. The decision by the two eminent bards of classic rock to pull their tunes came shortly before Spotify warned of tepid subscriber growth.
The  bought Wordle, a free game where players guess five-letter words that has become popular on Twitter since its release in October (driving non-players mad as users tweet their scores). The Times wants to reach 10m digital subscribers by 2025, and may end up charging customers for Wordle to reach that goal, which would generate lots of four-letter words.
