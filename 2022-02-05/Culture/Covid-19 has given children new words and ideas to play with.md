# Covid-19 has given children new words and ideas to play with 
##### The pandemic has made play at once more modern and more old-fashioned

“AT SCHOOL, I’VE invented a game with my friends,” says Griffin, a nine-year-old Australian boy. The rules of Corona Tip are simple. One child chases the others, touching as many as he can. Anyone caught is “in corona”. They join the chaser in pursuit of those remaining, as do all the children they tag in turn—a neat demonstration of exponential growth. The game ends when everybody has been caught.
Griffin’s account was collected by the Pandemic Play Project, one of several groups researching children’s behaviour in the covid-19 era. Children in many countries were kept apart for long spells in 2020 and 2021. When they returned to school, they were often banned from touching. Playgrounds have been segregated by year group and some equipment removed. How have these changes affected play?

It is partly an anthropological question. Some of the researchers are inspired by Iona and Peter Opie, who wrote a series of books about children’s games, songs, rhymes and jokes beginning in the late 1940s. The Opies argued that primary-school children had a distinct oral culture, which they transmitted to each other under the noses of adults. Much of their lore was decades, even centuries old. Children’s culture, they wrote, is as special as that of “some dwindling aboriginal tribe”.
Today’s researchers have spotted many examples of covid-19 permeating play. Australian children invented a game in which they chase each other with stones, which stand in for vaccines. Thomas Enemark Lundtofte of the University of Southern Denmark has heard children singing about covid—sometimes echoing pop songs, sometimes making up their own. The British-based Play Observatory has collected accounts of children playing covid-themed games at home. In one video a young girl swabs the nose of her toy horse with a plastic screwdriver.
In some ways the pandemic seems to have made children’s play more modern. More of it takes place online: during lockdowns children spent more time playing video games like “Animal Crossing” and “Roblox” than was allowed before. That helped them keep in touch with each other, and also coloured their offline play. When one group of Australian children saw each other again, they tried to re-enact “Among Us”, a multiplayer video game in which some characters attempt to kill the others.
But in other ways play became more old-fashioned. Alison Stenning of Newcastle University found that in 2020, during England’s first lockdown, children recolonised streets that they had ceded to cars over the years. They drew pavement games in chalk, just as their grandparents had done. When balls were banned in school playgrounds, children adopted a venerable dodge and used rolled-up gloves instead.
Julia Bishop of the University of Sheffield suspects that references to covid and “corona” will linger in children’s lore, although they might become detached from the disease itself. “They like weird words,” she says. A killjoy would point out that Griffin’s game is almost identical to others (such as Infection) that were played before covid-19. But one characteristic of children’s lore, which the Opies noticed, is that its practitioners often claim to have just invented things that are in fact very old. ■
