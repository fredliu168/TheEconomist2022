By Kate Atkinson. 
A General Strike looms, but the focus of Kate Atkinson’s exuberant new novel, set in London in 1926, is the seedy, artificial world of the capital’s nightclubs. Presiding over it is the formidable Nellie Coker, matriarch of a large brood of mostly dissolute adult children (and based, an afterword reveals, on Kate Meyrick, a real nightlife doyenne of the 1920s). Over the course of the book, Nellie’s vast, ill-gotten empire is targeted by unscrupulous outsiders and a decent, dogged copper.
Ms Atkinson’s award-winning novels include the “Case Histories” crime series and a loose trilogy set in the early 20th century that began with “Life After Life”. Her stories often depict the dispensing of rough-and-ready justice and the avenging of lost girls and ill-treated young women. And there are missing girls aplenty in “Shrines of Gaiety”, to whose fate the police are largely indifferent—apart from newly appointed Chief Inspector Frobisher. 
Spirited off the street into mysterious cars, their corpses later pulled from the Thames at a spot known as Dead Man’s Hole, the victims are under-age “hostesses” in theatres or clubs, including Nellie’s main nightspot, the Amethyst. Some are runaways. Freda Murgatroyd, a teenager, leaves a sticky situation in her home city of York and persuades her better-heeled friend Florence to accompany her down to London. They want to make their fortunes on the stage, but Florence disappears into Soho’s maw: “It was not just like being in a foreign country, it was like being in a hundred foreign countries at once.” 
Hot on their trail is Gwendolen Kelling, an embodiment of pluck and independence. Recruited by Frobisher to spy on the Coker operation, Gwendolen forms a bond with Nellie’s eldest son, Niven; he was a soldier on the Western Front, she a nurse. The first world war and its losses haunt the book, from Gwendolen’s dead brothers to Frobisher’s continental wife, a refugee whose past traumas shroud her origins and blight their marriage. 
Yet this is no gloomy yarn. It froths with all-night parties, corrupt policemen, sickly cocktails, swanky cars, gossip columnists, gambling dens and beautiful clothes. Another of Nellie’s sons tries to capture the zeitgeist in a dreadful novel called “The Age of Glitter”, a nod to “Vile Bodies”, Evelyn Waugh’s satire of the era of the Bright Young Things. There are also references to popular songs of the day, T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land” and the “curse of Tutankhamun” (Egyptology was all the rage after the boy-king’s tomb was discovered). As the book hurtles towards its twisty climax, Ms Atkinson once again proves herself to be a consummate entertainer. ■
