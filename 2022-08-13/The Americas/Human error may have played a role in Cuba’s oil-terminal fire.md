Lightning hit a storage tank at Cuba’s main oil terminal in Matanzas, starting a fire that spread to three other tanks. One firefighter died and 14 are missing. The lightning rod had not been maintained, say reports in independent media. The fire contributed to a water shortage that forced the shutdown of a nearby power plant. Cuba was already suffering from fuel shortages and blackouts, which had triggered protests.
