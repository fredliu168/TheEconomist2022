# Should “data” be singular or plural? 
##### On a curiously polarising debate in English grammar

For more than a millennium after the fall of Rome, educated Europeans were distinguished by their knowledge of Latin. One of the three subjects of the —the basic tier of a classical education, itself based on a Roman model—was Latin grammar. Europeans have long since stopped writing primarily in Latin, but learned people are still expected to be able to deduce that to “decimate” means to destroy a tenth of something (a mutinous legion was punished in this way), or sprinkle and into their speech.
It is not for lack of knowledge of, or affection for, Latin that  marks a change this week. The reform involves one of the most curiously polarising issues an ending on a foreign word has ever generated in English. We will now allow singular use of alongside the plural. Specifically, when considered as a concept—as in —the singular will be acceptable, as well as when the data in question is considered as a mass  However, when data points are considered as a group of pieces of information, the plural should still be used: .
, as every child at a grammar school once knew, is the plural of Latin’s , “something given”. Originally that plural sense was carried over into English. But already in 1702, the Oxford English Dictionary records, came the first appearance of singular , in an astronomy textbook. This was almost 60 years after plural  was first recorded.
The rise of computing has changed the balance. While an 18th-century scholar’s data might be a single column of numbers, today’s computers quickly manage billions of bytes. Data points begin to seem like the water molecules in the ocean and so, in such contexts, to be perceived as a mass. Singular data is now more common than the plural in books, and far more prevalent on the web.
Data is hardly the first foreign word to undergo grammatical change in English. The nearest equivalent is , an old plural of , “something to be acted on”. Once those collected  started being thought of as a list, the English singular was born. (,  and  were all Latin plurals, too.) ’s style guide prescribes a list of Latin -um words in English that pluralise with -a (, ), but many more that violate Latin grammar and take -ums (). It demonstrates that those words are now English; Latin rules need not apply.
Those who oppose singular data argue that the word refers to a set of numbers. Yet the properties of the thing itself are not a reliable guide to a term’s grammar. Go to a shop where dried goods are sold from barrels and note rice (a singular) next to lentils (a plural), and wheat (singular) next to oats (plural). Head to the pasta section and see what happens to other languages’ words in English: and , both Italian plurals, are singular when served up in English. 
Will readers be confused if they see both singular and plural data? Probably not. Plural data in the sense of “data points” will probably appear in one kind of story exclusively (ie, those reporting on a study based on a number of observations), and mass-style singular data in others (especially those to do with computing). In any case, our style guide already allows some collective nouns, like or to be singular or plural depending on whether it is the entity or its constituents under discussion, with no resulting chaos.
You will not find a singular  in our pages (a back-formation of the Greek , which is singular however much it may look like an English plural). Nor should you see  or .  will remain plural though, as with data, usage in the wider world varies between singular and plural.
And if you need a piece of trivia for your next cocktail party: that mentioned in the first paragraph was, indeed, the source of . Exactly as with data, it was a Latin plural—now, for most speakers, it is an English singular. ( is four times as common as in books, and the phrase  can only go with singular nouns.) It is poignant that a word that once meant a knowledge of Latin now means a knowledge of impractical random facts.
Johnson does not consider grammar trivial. Precisely for that reason it is time to recognise the facts of English grammar: usage of has changed, and will change with it.■
