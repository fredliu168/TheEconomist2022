One of the three subjects of the trivium—the basic tier of a classical education, itself based on a Roman model—was Latin grammar. Europeans have long since stopped writing primarily in Latin, but learned people are still expected to be able to deduce that to “decimate” means to destroy a tenth of something (a mutinous legion was punished in this way), or sprinkle annus mirabilis and mutatis mutandis into their speech.\nIt is not for lack of knowledge of, or affection for, Latin that The Economist marks a change this week. The reform involves one of the most curiously polarising issues an ending on a foreign word has ever generated in English. We will now allow singular use of data alongside the plural. Specifically, when considered as a concept—as in data is the new oil—the singular will be acceptable, as well as when the data in question is considered as a mass (the data on this mobile-phone plan is insufficient). However, when data points are considered as a group of pieces of information, the plural should still be used: data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicate the hottest summer of all time.\nData, as every child at a grammar school once knew, is the plural of Latin’s datum, “something given”. Originally that plural sense was carried over into English. But already in 1702, the Oxford English Dictionary records, came the first appearance of singular data, in an astronomy textbook. This was almost 60 years after plural data was first recorded.\nThe rise of computing has changed the balance. While an 18th-century scholar’s data might be a single column of numbers, today’s computers quickly manage billions of bytes. Data points begin to seem like the water molecules in the ocean and so, in such contexts, to be perceived as a mass. Singular data is now more common than the plural in books, and far more prevalent on the web.\nData is hardly the first foreign word to undergo grammatical change in English. The nearest equivalent is agenda, an old plural of agendum, “something to be acted on”. Once those collected agenda started being thought of as a list, the English singular was born. (Candelabra, stamina and insignia were all Latin plurals, too.) The Economist’s style guide prescribes a list of Latin -um words in English that pluralise with -a (memoranda, strata), but many more that violate Latin grammar and take -ums (forums, stadiums, ultimatums). It demonstrates that those words are now English; Latin rules need not apply.\nThose who oppose singular data argue that the word refers to a set of numbers. Yet the properties of the thing itself are not a reliable guide to a term’s grammar. Go to a shop where dried goods are sold from barrels and note rice (a singular) next to lentils (a plural), and wheat (singular) next to oats (plural). Head to the pasta section and see what happens to other languages’ words in English: spaghetti and lasagne, both Italian plurals, are singular when served up in English. \nWill readers be confused if they see both singular and plural data? Probably not. Plural data in the sense of “data points” will probably appear in one kind of story exclusively (ie, those reporting on a study based on a number of observations), and mass-style singular data in others (especially those to do with computing). In any case, our style guide already allows some collective nouns, like council or staff, to be singular or plural depending on whether it is the entity or its constituents under discussion, with no resulting chaos.\nYou will not find a singular kudo in our pages (a back-formation of the Greek kudos, which is singular however much it may look like an English plural). Nor should you see a criteria or a phenomena. Media will remain plural though, as with data, usage in the wider world varies between singular and plural.\nAnd if you need a piece of trivia for your next cocktail party: that trivium mentioned in the first paragraph was, indeed, the source of trivia. Exactly as with data, it was a Latin plural—now, for most speakers, it is an English singular. (Trivia is is four times as common as trivia are in books, and the phrase a piece of can only go with singular nouns.) It is poignant that a word that once meant a knowledge of Latin now means a knowledge of impractical random facts.\nJohnson does not consider grammar trivial. Precisely for that reason it is time to recognise the facts of English grammar: usage of data has changed, and The Economist will change with it.■ \nRead more from Johnson, our columnist on language:\nSome language rules are valuable; others are piffling (Jul 14th)\nThe everyday miracle of writing (Jun 30th)\nFar be it from the English to use the subjunctive (Jun 16th)","about":{"public":null,"__typename":"Taxonomies"},"print":{"headline":"The data is in","section":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/culture/","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","headline":"Culture"},"__typename":"Print"},"articleSection":{"public":null,"internal":[{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/culture/","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","id":"/content/rvj2s19g2lkbek4tevm6sn1va1se84sl","tegID":"rvj2s19g2lkbek4tevm6sn1va1se84sl","headline":"Culture","hasPart":{"parts":[{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/11/a-league-of-their-own-examines-race-and-gender-in-baseballs-past","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","id":"/content/lopadieruqatv4i101uhup5bcgt49ah6","type":["Article","NewsArticle","AnalysisNewsArticle"],"headline":"“A League of Their Own” examines race and gender in baseball’s past","subheadline":"No crying in baseball","datePublished":"2022-08-11T15:16:43Z","description":"A TV drama celebrates both female and black players","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20220813_BLP509.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media","promo":null}},{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/11/a-history-of-jazzs-relationship-with-organised-crime","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","id":"/content/9hs79vk32do4mk21rbc2ctg9h8725pdp","type":["Article","NewsArticle","AnalysisNewsArticle"],"headline":"A history of jazz’s relationship with organised crime","subheadline":"Playing fast and loose","datePublished":"2022-08-11T15:00:20Z","description":"T.J.

- Should “data” be singular or plural? | Culture | The Economist","shareSnippet":"Johnson – Should “data” be singular or plural?","headline":"Should “data” be singular or plural?","section":"Culture","keywords":[],"author":["The Economist"],"url":"https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/11/should-data-be-singular-or-plural","type":"Article","articleBody":"For more than a millennium after the fall of Rome, educated Europeans were distinguished by their knowledge of Latin. One of the three subjects of the trivium—the basic tier of a classical education, itself based on a Roman model—was Latin grammar. Europeans have long since stopped writing primarily in Latin, but learned people are still expected to be able to deduce that to “decimate” means to destroy a tenth of something (a mutinous legion was punished in this way), or sprinkle annus mirabilis and mutatis mutandis into their speech.\nIt is not for lack of knowledge of, or affection for, Latin that The Economist marks a change this week. The reform involves one of the most curiously polarising issues an ending on a foreign word has ever generated in English. We will now allow singular use of data alongside the plural. Specifically, when considered as a concept—as in data is the new oil—the singular will be acceptable, as well as when the data in question is considered as a mass (the data on this mobile-phone plan is insufficient). However, when data points are considered as a group of pieces of information, the plural should still be used: data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicate the hottest summer of all time.\nData, as every child at a grammar school once knew, is the plural of Latin’s datum, “something given”. Originally that plural sense was carried over into English. But already in 1702, the Oxford English Dictionary records, came the first appearance of singular data, in an astronomy textbook. This was almost 60 years after plural data was first recorded.\nThe rise of computing has changed the balance. While an 18th-century scholar’s data might be a single column of numbers, today’s computers quickly manage billions of bytes. Data points begin to seem like the water molecules in the ocean and so, in such contexts, to be perceived as a mass. Singular data is now more common than the plural in books, and far more prevalent on the web.\nData is hardly the first foreign word to undergo grammatical change in English. The nearest equivalent is agenda, an old plural of agendum, “something to be acted on”. Once those collected agenda started being thought of as a list, the English singular was born. (Candelabra, stamina and insignia were all Latin plurals, too.) The Economist’s style guide prescribes a list of Latin -um words in English that pluralise with -a (memoranda, strata), but many more that violate Latin grammar and take -ums (forums, stadiums, ultimatums). It demonstrates that those words are now English; Latin rules need not apply.\nThose who oppose singular data argue that the word refers to a set of numbers. Yet the properties of the thing itself are not a reliable guide to a term’s grammar. Go to a shop where dried goods are sold from barrels and note rice (a singular) next to lentils (a plural), and wheat (singular) next to oats (plural). Head to the pasta section and see what happens to other languages’ words in English: spaghetti and lasagne, both Italian plurals, are singular when served up in English. \nWill readers be confused if they see both singular and plural data? Probably not. Plural data in the sense of “data points” will probably appear in one kind of story exclusively (ie, those reporting on a study based on a number of observations), and mass-style singular data in others (especially those to do with computing). In any case, our style guide already allows some collective nouns, like council or staff, to be singular or plural depending on whether it is the entity or its constituents under discussion, with no resulting chaos.\nYou will not find a singular kudo in our pages (a back-formation of the Greek kudos, which is singular however much it may look like an English plural). Nor should you see a criteria or a phenomena. Media will remain plural though, as with data, usage in the wider world varies between singular and plural.\nAnd if you need a piece of trivia for your next cocktail party: that trivium mentioned in the first paragraph was, indeed, the source of trivia. Exactly as with data, it was a Latin plural—now, for most speakers, it is an English singular. (Trivia is is four times as common as trivia are in books, and the phrase a piece of can only go with singular nouns.) It is poignant that a word that once meant a knowledge of Latin now means a knowledge of impractical random facts.\nJohnson does not consider grammar trivial. Precisely for that reason it is time to recognise the facts of English grammar: usage of data has changed, and The Economist will change with it.■ \nRead more from Johnson, our columnist on
