# How not to administer justice after a brutal civil war 
##### Post-war reconciliation in Nepal is a nice idea. Too bad about the politics

It has been 20 years since Sushila Chaudhary’s sister was abducted from her village by Nepal’s army, never to return. It has been 18 years since soldiers came to her brother’s house, locked him in a room, and tortured and killed him. Ms Chaudhary, now a lawyer in her mid-30s, has spent the better part of two decades trying to find out who killed her brother and what happened to her sister. Like many others who lost family members during Nepal’s civil war from 1996 to 2006, or who themselves suffered abuse, she has been frustrated by the authorities. “I am sure there are records of who is responsible,” she says. “But they have never given them to us.”
More than 17,000 people were killed, 1,300 were “disappeared”—kidnapped and probably killed—and tens of thousands were displaced during the war, which pitted Maoist insurgents against the government of what was then still a constitutional monarchy. The war ended with a negotiated peace supervised by the un after the king, who had sought to crush the insurgency by assuming total control late in the conflict, was forced to return some powers to Parliament. Soon after, Nepal became a republic.
One stipulation of the peace deal was a commitment by both parties to a proper process of what lawyers and human-rights types call “transitional justice”, or healing war wounds by revealing the whereabouts of the disappeared, making a record of atrocities and trying perpetrators in court. That commitment remained on paper. Democratisation ended the 240-year-old monarchy, but it also turned former adversaries into politicians. They had little desire to draw attention to past sins. Neither side ever released any information about the whereabouts of the disappeared. 
In 2014, after years of dilly-dallying, the government set up two commissions—one to investigate disappearances and the other to examine other human-rights violations—as part-fulfilment of conditions laid down in the peace agreement. The commissions received a combined total of more than 60,000 complaints and have had their mandate extended several times, most recently in July. Yet neither one has ever held a single hearing or referred a case to the courts. Most observers reckon that they were set up to fail. “They had enough good people to make them look plausible, but enough saboteurs to ensure nothing would happen,” says Kanak Mani Dixit, a journalist who has kept a close eye on them.
Earlier this year, Ms Chaudhary and other advocates had reason to think that things might change. In April Govinda Sharma Bandi, a prominent lawyer who had long pushed the government to do more to investigate war crimes, was appointed justice minister in a cabinet reshuffle. He said he planned to make the revival of the push for transitional justice the central goal of his tenure. The governing parties, keen to curry favour with international donors, looked likely to play along. Moreover, some younger army brass had begun to grumble about being barred from well-paying un peacekeeping jobs because of lingering questions over past atrocities, raising hopes that the armed forces’ resistance might be softening, too.
Last month Mr Bandi presented to Parliament a bill amending the flawed law that set up the commissions in 2014. It would make it harder for those who committed serious crimes to receive amnesty. It would also give victims the right to reparations and relatives of the disappeared the right to their property. Critics say the new version is still riddled with loopholes that would allow culprits to escape justice, and that it provides insufficient resources for investigations. Still, Mr Bandi hopes it will clear the way for a new commission to start working on the mountain of complaints at last. 
“It is not perfect,” he admits, “but some level of compromise is necessary in transitional justice.”
If the law passes, the government must implement it. However, the political environment has not changed enough for that to happen. Former combatants from both sides remain in power. Their appetite for investigating themselves has not grown. The law may end up as a fig leaf.
That possibility—even likelihood—provides a useful, if disheartening, lesson for those pursuing post-war justice elsewhere: when prosecuting wartime abuses, formal legal provisions matter less than politics. As long as those who committed the crimes remain in power, it is fiendishly difficult for victims to obtain justice, or even a hint of the truth.■
