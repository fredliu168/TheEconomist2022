Insurance regulation makes few hearts race. So it is odd that this summer Liz Truss, the front-runner in the Conservatives’ leadership contest, should have peppered her hustings speeches to party members with mentions of Solvency II, a set of prudential European rules for insurers. But for Ms Truss’s audience, Solvency II has a couple of features that may quicken the pulse. It was designed by the eu, so it is ripe to be ripped away. And would-be reformers say it could be refashioned to free up tens of billions of pounds for investment in Britain’s economy.
Britain’s insurance industry holds assets worth some £2trn ($2.4trn, or 90% of gdp). Set against the country’s thirst for long-term investment—in infrastructure to help with “levelling up”, or the net-zero transition—that pot of capital is too tempting to ignore. Solvency II specifies how much of it must be earmarked for ensuring insurers can meet future liabilities. In turn, that determines how much they hold in low-risk assets like government bonds, and how much can be put into racier ventures like wind farms or social housing.
The industry has long argued that Solvency II’s calculations are too conservative. An independent report commissioned by the Association of British Insurers (abi), an industry group, concluded in 2021 that the group’s proposed reforms could release £95bn of investment. In February a speech by John Glen, then the Treasury’s City minister, suggested the government broadly agreed with the abi’s proposals. But the Prudential Regulation Authority (pra), whose task it is to maintain financial stability, then suggested further tweaks. The pra says that its version should still free up between £45bn and £90bn. The abi says it may prevent any capital from being released at all and even force some insurers to hold more.
The reforms focus on two areas: the risk margin and the matching adjustment, explains Sean McGuire of Oliver Wyman, a consultancy. Both concern how future liabilities are valued today. The risk margin specifies how much should be added to them, to account for the risk that they rise (because annuity holders live longer than expected, say). The matching adjustment assigns liabilities a lower value if the insurer invests in assets that match them (for instance, a bond guaranteeing cashflows identical to a policyholder’s annuity).
Both the industry and the pra agree that the risk margin should be reduced, and that the matching adjustment should be broadened to allow insurers to invest in a wider range of assets—such as renewable energy projects. But the regulator also thinks the matching adjustment should be made much less generous, paying more heed to the risk that the matched asset fails to pay out (because of a bond default, for instance). That would make insurers safer, but reduce the amount of capital released by the reform.
The regulator and the industry are also at odds over how much of a difference this would make to the capital released. One insurance executive argues that life insurers sell off most of their risk from new business to foreign buyers, whereas the pra’s calculations assume that they keep half of it on their books. That blunts the impact of reducing the risk margin, because it isn’t required for risk that has been reinsured. Others fear that the end of transitional arrangements from Solvency II’s initial implementation will soak up more capital.
The result is a series of trade-offs: how much the next government wants to scrap with the pra, what value it places on investment versus financial stability, and whether insurers choose to invest any freed-up capital or simply return it to their shareholders. Big Bang 2.0 may not be forthcoming after all.■
