###### Bashing the bean-counters
# Reducing the power of the Treasury is a good idea 
##### Don’t break it up. But do give departments more freedom

The conservative party has been in office for 12 years. Its likely next leader knows where blame lies for sluggish economic growth: Liz Truss criticises the “economic orthodoxy” of Her Majesty’s Treasury. That suits Ms Truss tactically: her rival, Rishi Sunak, is a former chancellor of the exchequer. But others echo the charge. Kemi Badenoch, a former leadership candidate, thinks the Treasury should be broken up, with responsibility for economic growth shifted to 10 Downing Street.
Some outside the political fray also say the finance ministry is due for an overhaul. In May Stian Westlake, chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society, proposed splitting its responsibilities for growth, spending and finance. There is a good case for reforming the Treasury—but there are better ideas than breaking it up.
The ministry’s 2,000-odd staff carry out some of the meatiest functions of government: tax, spending and fostering economic growth. They plan the chancellor’s two big annual policy set-pieces—the spring statement and the autumn budget. Departmental spending is set, after negotiations, in triennial reviews. Any interim shuffling of resources needs approval if it is “novel, contentious or could cause repercussions elsewhere in the public sector”. All this gives chancellors and their officials great power. Boris Johnson is not the first prime minister to fall out terminally with the neighbour at Number 11. 
Few question Treasury officials’ competence. A powerful finance ministry can be a useful filter of hare-brained ideas. “Someone has to say when something isn’t affordable or may have no effect,” says Lord Macpherson, the Treasury’s top civil servant between 2005 and 2016. Because chancellors make the big decisions, some criticisms would be better aimed at their choices than at the institution. Still, on three counts, the critics have a point.
The first is that officials focus too much on short-term savings and not enough on long-term outcomes. In a survey in 2018 of staff in other departments who had contact with the Treasury’s spending teams, just 42% agreed that these teams considered the long-term impact of funding decisions. Efforts to embed thinking about outcomes, including a Public Value Unit established in 2019, have not taken off. Lord Agnew, a Treasury minister until January, says the unit had been unable to overturn “the more ingrained culture of monitoring short-term expenditure”. 
The second set of concerns relates to the Treasury’s tight control over departmental spending. Treasury types are unapologetic. “The fact that we keep going on about how terrible the Treasury is suggests that at least it is effective, unlike most arms of government,” says Lord Macpherson. But what looks to one side like necessary vigilance can appear to the other as needless micromanagement. Moving a mere £5m ($6.5m) between skills programmes within the Department for Education required “lengthy negotiations” with the Treasury, says a former insider, slowing down other programmes.
The chancellor’s own priorities can receive rather less scrutiny. Had “Eat Out to Help Out”, a wheeze to spend £849m subsidising restaurant meals during the covid-19 pandemic, come from elsewhere, it would have had short shrift. Treasury control also dulls spending departments’ incentives to innovate or find savings once a policy is in train. “Departments lose their brains,” says a former Treasury adviser. 
The third worry is that the Treasury pays too little heed to long-term economic growth. “No ceo would put the finance department in charge of sales,” Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said recently. An ex-adviser sighs that although the Treasury has teams dedicated to growth, the bean-counters rule the roost. Last October the government deferred, for two years, the date by which it will hit its target for research and development spending. 
A specific complaint is that the Treasury’s framework for assessing value for money is poorly suited to judging projects that have uncertain outcomes. Granted, weighty schemes can get through: £800m is to be spent on a new Advanced Research and Invention Agency. But the Treasury can strain at smaller amounts—if, say, bidders cannot say precisely how many jobs a research programme might one day create. 
Yet there is little evidence that breaking up the Treasury would fix these problems. True, America, Germany and Japan have separate finance and economy ministries. But that shows only that it can be done, not that it would help. Sir Howard Davies, author of “The Chancellors”, a new book about the Treasury in the past quarter-century, argues that Britain is unlike other countries in that it needs an institutional counterweight to its otherwise extremely powerful prime ministers.
What should be done? More autonomy for departments would help. In the Netherlands, ministries have their own finance offices to deal with spending reallocations. Lord Agnew favours creating an Office of Economic Growth, reporting directly to the prime minister. It would set rules on cost-benefit analysis, preventing the Treasury from marking its own homework, and analyse policies’ effects on growth. Expanding the remit and resources of the Office of Budget Responsibility, the government’s independent fiscal watchdog, to think harder about growth may also be wise. 
Ms Truss may not be satisfied with such technocratic tweaks. But she (or Mr Sunak) would do better to harness the power of the chancellor and the Treasury than to work against it. The next prime minister will surely choose their neighbour with care. ■
