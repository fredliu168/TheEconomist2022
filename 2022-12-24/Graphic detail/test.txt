Rather than covid-19, however, in 2022 readers have focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThese rankings come from a dataset of 6.5m stories on 32 newsy topics compiled by Chartbeat, an analytics firm. Of the 1bn hours audiences spent reading them, the war accounted for 278m in total—a similar share to covid’s in 2021—and 6.4m on the day the invasion began. That exceeds the combined first-day tallies for the death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II and Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars. Readership fell slowly until May, and has averaged 550,000 hours a day since then. That is just above the daily rate for the men’s football World Cup recently won by Argentina.\nVarious American political topics also ranked highly, though this may reflect the concentration of Chartbeat’s clients in English-speaking markets. The midterm elections racked up 145m hours and Joe Biden 137m. Strikingly, Donald Trump, now just a former president, still amassed 100m—matching the combined total for stories about politics in Britain, which ran through three prime ministers in 50 days.\n\n\n\nAs for the previous year’s leading subject, pandemic fatigue among audiences set in just as the war in Ukraine began. In early January the then-novel Omicron variant was the biggest story, peaking at 800,000 hours of readers’ time on January 6th. Since then, however, interest has waned, even though the death toll attributable to covid in 2022 is probably similar to that of 2020. Only when protests erupted in November against the Chinese government’s strict lockdowns did the pandemic briefly recapture readers’ attention.■\nChart source: Chartbeat","description":"Russia’s invasion accounted for one-quarter of news-reading hours","ogDescription":"Russia’s invasion accounted for one-quarter of news-reading hours","imageUrl":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20221224_WOT980.png","imageHeight":724,"imageWidth":1280,"datePublished":"2022-12-20T14:53:05Z","dateModified":"2022-12-20T14:53:05Z","dateCreated":"2022-12-19T16:15:07Z","isPrintArticle":true,"printEdition":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","copyrightYear":2022,"dateline":"","inLanguage":"en","interactive":true,"scripts":["https://infographics.economist.com1","https://infographics.economist.com1"],"css":[]},"sectionArticles":[{"id":"/content/lofbdnrg3fqgh95suai9tfmou9r9bb6j","publication":[{"id":"/content/f0e872f2ipoun91v1goki0jb4va2v5ei","context":{"position":2000.67,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/kptir3qsjfa28fb0j13jl2dbuio9mmnn","context":{"position":2000.67,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/q54evql23r7u092t8ijo0qrsng4mk1o0","context":{"position":2000.67,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/c1k7m10f9c60bv0o8jjvqplr8n4ovca4","context":{"position":2000.67,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/pvn8tvad7nsf4fsnhljms0mpnjh8f670","context":{"position":2000.67,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/pk3m88qhj2e940uud6s6jlgtmvn8uv5t","context":{"position":2000.67,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"},{"id":"/content/rb25s4epl1jul3gnkpbvbos0secm0abi","context":{"position":2000.67,"__typename":"Content"},"__typename":"Content"}],"headline":"War replaces disease as the world’s most newsworthy subject","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/12/20/war-replaces-disease-as-the-worlds-most-newsworthy-subject","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content"}]},"newContent":{},"isCP2Content":false,"statusCode":200,"paywallCheck":{"shouldDropPaywall":false},"featureFlags":["SF_SIGNPOSTING","ESPRESSO_AUDIO","SOURCEPOINT","ONBOARDING_NOTIFICATION","ONBOARDING_GROUP_NOTIFICATION","OPTIMIZELY_SELF_HOSTING","LAPSED_USER_NOTIFICATION","NEW_METADATA","IN_THIS_REPORT","REGISTRANT_ONBOARDING","SAVED_STORIES_SWITCHOVER","ARTICLE_GIFTING_SWITCHOVER","SITEMAP"],"newsletters":{"newsletters":[{"code":"plot_twist","availableTo":["core"],"ident":"plot-twist","title":"Plot Twist","frequency":"Weekly","imageUrl":"https://myaccount.economist.com/file-asset-public/Plot_Twist?oid=00D3z000002JvyiEAC","tagline":"Subscriber only","slug":"plot-twist","hasPreview":false,"isNew":true,"description":"A weekly conversation about culture.
