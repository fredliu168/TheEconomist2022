At the age of 18 Asher Friedman (not his real name) could still neither read nor speak English. His parents, both ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jews, had sent him to an unregistered boys’ school in Stamford Hill, in east London, when he was three. Pupils studied scripture for up to 14 hours a day. Beatings with belts or sticks were common. Around 250 boys shared three toilets and there was no soap in the bathrooms—they were told it was a secular extravagance. His brother, who still attends the school, says little has changed.
Ofsted, England’s schools inspectorate, reckons tens of thousands of children attend unregistered schools. Victor Shafiee, deputy leader of Ofsted’s task force to tackle the problem, says accurate figures are almost impossible to collect. His team has investigated more than 900 unregistered settings since 2016. “My inspector’s intuition tells me [what we’re seeing is] the tip of the iceberg,” he says. 
In law a school is currently defined as an institution that provides full-time education to at least five children (or to one with learning difficulties). Any institution that meets these criteria must register; not doing so is illegal. State and private schools have different obligations, but all registered institutions must provide an appropriate, broad curriculum, safe premises and checks on staff.
Under existing rules, if an institution’s provision strays from what might be reasonably termed a curriculum, it no longer meets the definition of a school. The worse the teaching, in other words, the harder it is to prosecute proprietors of such establishments. Just six prosecutions have been brought successfully since 2016. 
Councils can compel a child to attend school if they find that they are not being properly taught. But it is often hard to identify children who attend unregistered schools. Parents frequently claim they are being home-schooled; records are incomplete; and resources are stretched thin. 
Ofsted’s powers are limited in this area, too. Inspectors can enter premises of unregistered schools but their powers to search are restricted (some recall finding sawdust below cupboards that had been newly screwed shut). In the rare cases when proprietors have been prosecuted, Ofsted cannot shut the schools down. Those found guilty are normally fined a few hundred pounds; some are given a suspended jail sentence. Two of the six successful prosecutions were brought against the same school: the proprietor kept it open after her first conviction.
The reasons why unregistered schools exist vary. Many cater to children who cannot attend mainstream schools, often because of poor behaviour or learning difficulties. Registered alternatives are oversubscribed. Around one in five unregistered schools that Ofsted has inspected since 2016 are religious: half of this cohort are Muslim, and around a quarter each are Jewish and Christian.
Richy Thompson of Humanists uk, a secularist charity, reckons the true figures are probably higher, because Ofsted can only class as religious those schools that obviously appear so when they visit. Parents of children at these schools usually want them to lead a more insular life. Unregistered Jewish schools are almost unique in eschewing secular teaching altogether; other faith groups may take issue with specific parts of mainstream teaching, such as sex education. 
As well as risking children’s education, many unregistered schools are unsafe. Because of their clandestine nature, they are frequently housed in unsuitable buildings: run-down offices or business parks. Sue Will, a senior inspector on the Ofsted task force, recalls asking staff at one school about fire exits; they told her that if the building burned down it would be God’s will. Nor is there any guarantee that those teaching children are suitable: many staff will not have had a background check. One unregistered school inspected by Ofsted was set up by a convicted sex offender; another is being investigated for alleged female genital mutilation on the premises. 
Change is coming. The Schools Bill, currently before the House of Lords, will widen the definition of a school to cover any institution that provides full-time “instruction or guidance on any matter”. It will create local registers of children who are not in school, allowing better oversight. And it will beef up Ofsted’s powers to inspect unregistered schools.
Campaigners agree that the bill is a good step. But some worry that unregistered schools will simply split into multiple part-time institutions, at least on paper, to evade prosecution. “We’ll probably have to see…where the new loopholes are,” says Eve Sacks of Nahamu, a Jewish charity that opposes the ultra-Orthodox way of life. Some unregistered schools will probably go further underground. Even if the law changes, Ofsted’s task force has only limited resources. 
As for Mr Friedman, he taught himself English and is now at a Russell Group university. But he finds his studies challenging, and fears he may have to quit: “It’s definitely because of the way I grew up.” ■
